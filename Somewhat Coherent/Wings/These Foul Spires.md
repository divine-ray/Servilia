These foul spires, intertwined with their wicked veins.
Who knows what they're hiding in these? 
What forsaken abominations are being enslaved to be our very sustenance?
Everything here revolves around [them](Numerator), they define our nation and society. 
Irregular and twisted like bricks being stacked another recklessly and held together by these abominable arteries. 
<p align="right">And the light. The lighting follows you everywhere, there is not a single crevice left undone. 
Glaring and over-saturated do the advertisements scream for attention.</p>
Little reach I can see, all is shrouded in the fumes and smoke.
Once more I- we- have to... think. What made us move here.. Certainly not any of those false promises of wealth or safety.
Gunfire is ringing out in the distance, distorted by echoing. 
[This city, nation](Amida). It's nothing but a monolith to greed and ineptitude of the individual to scale the challenges thrown at them. 
Look around, what do you see?
