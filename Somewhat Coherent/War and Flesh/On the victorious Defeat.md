So, it ends.
It finally found something worthy of it's chassis, the bittersweet feelings of emerging victorious after countless losses and defeats.
The machine has been bested, beaten.
The cacophony of destruction and war, which it orchestrated, put to a end.
Now it's rigid, inert hull, half buried, [[Sentinel of Steel|silently watches]] over the landscape, it's limbs amputated, spines carved out. 
Yet the remains of its host remain buried deeply within, gazing out on the world through blinding eyes, unable to change the point of view. The storms and thunders have long deafened what they called ears. 

But it is not the last of it's kind. Yet. 
There are many more to [[Deployed Giant|come]], to reclaim and revenge their losses.
Deep inside, clockwork, wires and neurons alike lie in dormant slumber, twitching and spazzing from jamming and neglect. 
The remains of it's cognition in anguish, stuck in paralysis; relieved yet infuriated about it's defeat, it's release from being one of Mekhane's Hands of Death.

Inside of it's metallic carcass vermin has settled, the children and descendants of what it was built to eradicate. The vermin is smart, and it knows that. Two deathly enemies, merged posthumous. They will [[Posthumous Unity|become one]], will live anothermore.
