So, it ends.
It finally found something worthy of it's shell, the bittersweet feelings of emerging victorious after countless losses and defeats.
The machine has been bested, beaten.
The cacophony of destruction and war, which it orchestrated, put to a end.
Now it's rigid, inert hull, half buried, silently watches over the landscape, it's innards gutted, unable to react or process anything.

But it is not the last of it's kind.
There are many more to [[Deployed Giant|come]], to reclaim and revenge their losses.
Deep inside, clockwork and wires alike lie in dormant slumber, twitching as they're jammed. 
The remains of it's cognition in anguish, stuck in paralysis; relieved yet infuriated about it's defeat, it's release from being one of Mekhane's Hands of Death.

Inside of it's metallic carcass vermin has settled, the children and descendants of what it was built to eradicate. The vermin is smart, and it knows that. Two deathly enemies, merged posthumous. They will [[Posthumous Unity|become one]], will live anothermore.
