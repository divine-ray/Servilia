The ear-shattering whistling, then the impact.
Everyone scuttles about, as if someone prodded a stick into an anthill, looking for bodies to recover, to secure. 
But there was nothing but smoulders, gore and red smears where the shell hit. 
Seconds after, the cacophony of gunfire, screams and explosions resumes.

The [[Red Plague]], which has claimed much land and lives. 
The [[Red Plague]]: our eternal enemy, whom we have been fighting. 
The Ceaseless Enemy, who first kills and then devours. 
The Bodies of its victims become the plague. 

Now the colossus has been noticed, and the frantic struggling on the battlefield ceased, both in shock and terror of the beast, equal to observing a bullet speeding at one's face.
