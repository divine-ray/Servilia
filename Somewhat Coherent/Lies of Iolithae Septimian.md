#Poetry 
Hear the story of Iolithae Septimian.
A temple stands up above the sea.
	Its people fish up a stone. It is a stone of great age. On that stone are words.
 The words are lies. The man of the temple reads those words. His finger runs along the stone.
<center> He frowns.</center>
	  "These words are sacred," he says. "But they may not be spoken."
		  He takes the stone. He keeps it in a hidden place.
			  A girl lives at the temple. Each week she takes down the stone.
  She cleans the chest it stays in. She replaces the cloth that is its bedding.
  She polishes the stone and sets it back.
	  She does not know how to read the words of the stone.
		  Yet they haunt her.
			  She finds herself knowing them. She finds herself wanting to say them because it is confusing for that girl to know the words, when they are not said.
				  These are the words of the stone:

---
Before the name of Heaven, before the name of Earth,  
	Nothing moved in nothing.  
		The waters of the sea were salt; chaos moved in them,  
			Chaos was the mother of the waters.
No field was formed, no marsh was to be seen;  
	The gods were none of them called into being;  
		None bore a name, no destinies were ordained;  
			Chaos she coiled and the seas were salt.
Then came the names of things. Then were born the gods.  
	Brightly burst in Heaven, writhing in the Earth,  
		Dank and cold and moving in the deeps below.
Everywhere was the noise of them  
	And the noise of them was wrong.
Then did the chaos trash in the darkness.  
	The chaos roared.  
		She raised up her children, smote the gods:  
			Answered the evil of them and the seas were salt.
The gods built walls to hold her out.  
	Walls and walls: encircled were they all.  
		Dynasties and kings, manners, places,  
			They set the world in order. They stripped the seas.
Made them naked, saltless,  
	Barren of the chaos of them,
		Put to use;  
			Subdued them, bound them, chained the world;
Wrapped it about the <font color="#a5a5a5">white</font> corpse of chaos  
	Made their many kingdoms of the earth
		And made white rock from the caps of all the waves.  
			Chaos she raged; chaos she wept.
It was grievous and she spat up this stone. 
	Let none forget the words of the primal waters.  
		Let them be remembered, sacred be;  
			To those who forget them shall come worse things than salt:
Chaos was the mother of the waters.  
	The waters of the sea are salt; chaos moves within them.  
		Nothing moves in nothing;  
			Before something, there is nothing:  
Before the names of Heaven.  
	Before the name of Earth.

Such are the words of the stone, and The Lies of Iolithae Septimian is their name.

These words trouble her.

She walks to the sea. She stands over it. She listens to its subtle roar and
wonders at the presence of it. She watches the men haul in their catch;
bountiful are the waters of the sea.
	She asks the man of the temple if the seas have always been fresh.
He looks afraid. He whips her. He cuts out her tongue. He bends her to his will.

And again:

Each week she takes down the stone.
	She cleans the chest it stays in. She replaces the cloth that is its bedding.
She polishes the stone and puts it back. She finds the words of the stone rising up
in her. She finds herself saying them in bits and pieces, even though she has no tongue.
	The words come out of her. It is as if they are real. It is as if they are more real
	than the mouth that no longer has a tongue, more real than the man and his whip, more real than the piled waters of the sea.

She keeps them quiet.
	She does not speak when others can hear, but sometimes she goes down to the cliffs
and she whispers them to the waves. She says them in snatches:
	…Wrapped it about with the corpse of chaos
Made their many kingdoms of the earth...
	Or
		…Chaos she raged; chaos she wept...
	Or
		…Nothing moves in nothing;
		Before something, there is nothing:
		Before the names of Heaven.
		Before the name of Earth...

The words grow stronger in her. She does not fight them.

The words travel out into the waters and they come back strong. She hears them
and she speaks them and they do not quell.
	In the temple the man of the temple is afraid. He disrespects the sacred thing.
		He takes the stone to the cliffs above the waters.
He casts it down. The sea pulls back, the ground grows teeth; he and the earth together,
they shatter the given stone. He goes home and forgets the words of the stone.
He forgets the Lies of Iolithae Septimian.
	The girl stands at the cliff amidst white rocks.
She speaks the lies that turn the seas to salt, and Iolithae Septimian is her nane,
and the seas grow black with strangled fish and white with salt and green with the given poisons.
The waves crash; they are loud, as the waves were never loud before. The temple crumbles.
The kingdom falls.
	If you have found these words do not forget them. Let them be remembered, sacred be.
If you should meet her walking in the world bow before her for she is sacred;
Bring her oil and fine cloth; 
Bow before her, three times bow; 
But she is Iolithae Septimian,

And you must not let her speak.
I do not know how you can prevent it but *you must not let her speak*.
