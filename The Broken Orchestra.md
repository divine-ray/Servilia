In an abandoned mining town, half buried by sand and dust, a lone theatre stands, untouched by the tooth of time and scavengers.
Built tall but wooden atop a solid stone foundation it seems to invite the lone traveller seeking shelter from the relentless conditions of sandstorms and searing Utuw. 

Yet, it has suffered a catastrophe of its own: fire. <sub>Or was it</sub> <sup>arson?</sup>
Slowly, like a vein of coal, it is smouldering away, a splinter of wood at a time.
The stage remains intact, as does many of the furniture and hallways, if one oversees embers flying everywhere. It‘s most peculiar, seeing the devastation and roaring of blazing fires devouring a stately building like such, at a snail’s pace. 
All visitors long gone, left with the rocks they gutted from Schi’s crust, left nothing important. Thus, all that remains are half burnt soot-covered mannequins and their costumes…
No human has bestowed these figures any attention in ages. 
Why would some traveller even take interest in a burnt theatre, spare for the shelter and firewood?
But then.. I can hear..

The music
it is heavenly
<sub>come, sit down</sub>
and listen to
our symphony
that we perfected
just for you
we have waited for 
you to listen
please, take a seat
and indulge in 
song
just for you~
