Wren kidnaps, or rather steals, people from their sleep into her library, where the vict- I mean playthin- I mean pet- I mean "Esteemed guests"^[((Yes that freudian slip will be very very reacurring in my videos someday))] stumble around and probably not really realize what they are even witnessing. 

It is a fairly nice library and archive of sorts, but even just touching or reading the book covers gives the unsuspecting visitor a headdache, constantly feeling like they are being watched and preyed on themselves, seeing things. Gateways and portals leading to dimensions and regions they can not even fathom all, stored and stacked in neat and tidy glass boxes. Inscriptions and labels on these boxes impossible to decrypt and interpret, as the writings are so, *so* alien and foreign. 
After time passed which felt like weeks, months or possibly even years they are eventually found by a crow-like entity, distinctly corvid in nature yet standing like an a regular human.  They presnet themselves with a really happy and cheerful attitude, entirely opposite of their fear and worries, as the crow elaborates on about the various dark disturbing truths of the worlds, as they seem to be very excited to share their novel hobby.
The tours usually are just a few hours long at most, as by that point the subjects... I mean play- I mean pets- "Esteemed Guests'" sanity has been  broken already, to which the crow will just be... perplexed, sad and left confused.  
How another mortal mind just ceased to work, seemingly at her fault, and she does not even fathom the concept of sanity, or that her collection is prone to break that strange thing in people.
So the crow remains in denial about her own insanity and madness. Of course she would think that they just had some bad reaction or were afraid of one thing in particular and willingly chose not to speak their mind.
"Oh dear, why didn't you say that the writings of `N??e???p??h???a??l?i?m??` ????, about 'The One that Lurks behind The Wall of Realities' aren't your thing?", the crow whispers to themselves, with a genuine, yet dumbfounded innocence; "What a shame, we didn't even get past its first volume..."
They take the now trembling, white-haired, yet still living husk of the former mortal and neatly sit them next to a look-alike, on an endlessly long bench in the "foyer",  hoping that someday
they might snap out of their 'slight overreaction'. In an attempt to not "frighten or disturb" their next *guests*, they simply throw a heavy white bedsheet above the trembling body to cover it up... 
Not knowing or fathoming that the sheer endless row of previous victims, which the new Guests are bound to see, will only add to the horror of it all.

They do not grasp even the concept of time, as it flows completely differently in their little pocket dimension.  They would not know how long she even toured some of them or how long they probably stumbled around in the library without her. 
She always thinks that she just pulls people out of their sleep for like five minutes in real time, not knowing that when these poor devils wake up in the real world, part of them is and will always be trapped there, especially with all the knowledge and horrible things they saw.
they would not know a dream of reality, trying desperately to tell it to others or paint it down, some even wanting to find enlightenment and sprouting cults in the faintest hope that that might eleviate their fading sanity... Which always just leads more people to
somehow hear of some unfathomable and horrible crow, whispering forbidden and maddening knowledge and showing horrible visions of an
impossible library in their dreams, which perpetuates the cycle even more... And confuses Wren whenever she hears of that or one of her
"Guests" recognizes her and pleas for mercy or something, not even fathoming that with that horrible Monster or Terrible God of Knowledge
they mean HER and not some really horrible God in her eyes. Also she has like a poppy, league of legends syndrome imposter syndrom, where
she does not acknowledge or refer to herself as a God or Deity, more as a "Placekeeper and Archivist, for the God of Knowledge and Madness
that will someday come and lead this Library again..." man they are sure taking their time tho... "Me being a god? Nah that is ridicoulus, I would
use powers not responsibly, and possibly go insane with power... Although, me being a little mad? *chuckles* Quite likely..." not even realizing or
acknowledging her potential, or why she can seemingly ever expand her Archive, when did she even start it, she cannot remember or how she
even came to be anymore, Time and the Void of Knowledge she has gathered and all the unfathomable things seemingly all blend together. So
she just... keeps doing as she does, collecting more horrible eldritch knowledge, and monsters, and portals into unknowable realms, as a means
of collecting very "Shiny and lovely looking and interesting" stuff... Also she once heard about a Cult of her in the Real World growing, didnt think
much of it, and even encouraged it by whispering some encouraging and sadly slightly maddening things into the ear of a few mortals... But
because she does not grasp time, by the time she checked in looking into a glass orb into the real world, or seeing with the eyes of crows and
ravens she can control, she realized her Cult in her absense became more horrifying and rather scared of her and tries to gather knowledge and
find people who would willingly venture into her realm of madness... To which she would just basically respond with the Anchorman meme "Oh
boy... That escalated quick
