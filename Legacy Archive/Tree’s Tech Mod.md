a molten metal system
you roll metal into sheets and then use other machines to refine those sheets
more advanced machines let you make more intricate parts from the sheets


basically plates rolled from molten metal would've been the main material, which would then be machined into gears or cut into rods or similar

with earlygame recipes for forging instead so you can like, get started; think like IE's recipes for hammering ingots
	early recipes will just be done with like
	an anvil and hammer


my idea was for the rolling machine to also be sequential somewhat like the Create sequenced assembly stuff, so if you want wires you could feed the plates through another rolling machine to further extrude it into wire
maybe i will add a steam hammer or something for basic automation (obviously not realistic but whatever)
	ok well in the case of plates maybe
	wires used to be made with automatic hammers 

anyways you will eventually get a crucible
	which would let you pour metals into clay casts
	the downside is that they \[take] a long time to cool
	which would encourage players to at some point upgrade to rolling sheets

....which i still need a reason to encourage players to like 
	have a lot of industry
	obviously that is just the production side of the mod there will be more
	i am thinking of like
	what the progression for cutting sheets is
	i want an laser cutter
	which will have massive power draw
	and require oxygen (which you can get easily by electrolysing water) 
	or ig nitrogen for more precise things
	since oxygen is a bitttt messy
	*but faster*

nitrogen i could maybe just have an atmospheric distillation tower or smth

before the advent of modern machinery, if the ingot was plate stock it went through a rolling machine and everything else went through the forge hammer in some capacity 


# encouraging production
you could do something akin to Factorio where things require mass quantities of materials as you progress past the early game
machines?
just making the processing machines more expensive is....redundant.


a satisfactory-esque build gun system you could have later game machines use more advanced materials and in higher quantities
	yeah that was the intent but i still need motivation
	i just have not figured out what yet


with something like Create's failure chance, you can push the player to do automation since the best countermeasure to your recipes possibly failing is to automate them
> As failure/loos chances turn into ratios and are usually neglible.

#  i was going to do a quality system actually!
"quality fun"
just don't half-ass it like factorio
	not the factorio one where
	"it magically becomes better"
i mean i think that part of Factorio's quality is good, where things work better (faster) with higher quality
	the issue is more so that in Factorio you can't use high quality parts in place of low quality ones, which makes zero fucking sense,
		makes working with quality a pain in the arse especially without recyclers
more like, things will have quality that impacts how it operates 
that quality can be affected by using more advanced systems to produce something, using higher quality parts, or in some cases there will be machines that increase quality values
such as a machine to sand the slag off of cut sheets
alternatively you could use a waterjet which will not produce slag

I mean, that doesn't encourage automation nearly as much as "the process requires constant player attention if you don't automate it" does
yeah the higher the quality % the better something would work
if you craft stuff it would take the mean of the parts used quality

getting to perfect quality would be incredibly difficult but also rewarding
it should also depend on what you use for the recipe
	like, making a high quality part in the basic wooden crafting bench is stupid
	so the crafting medium/machine will also have to impact quality


the main issue with quality i  see is that it's very annoying when you have an amount of the same item but they don't stack because they're different quality
	like for uranium you could get it from the ocean(?) automatically, or mine a lot of it normally
ok well quality will not RNG then
or each machine will have a percent range
i think it could be if it's framed differently
where instead of quality you frame it as explicitly different items
	so a quality tier prefix (common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary) (item)

so for example, instead of a low and high quality gear, you'd have a crude gear and a precision-cut gear
	Therefore, quality referring to direct level of machining and accuracy instead of a tiering that is imposed and feels artificial. 
	
and they're definitively different items

Higher qualtiies/degrees of precision shall be backwards compatible (being able to use an extruded rod in place where only a manually smithed rod would suffice)

 if you use all precision parts for something it will come out as precision


like if you use all precision gears for a mechanism it ends up being a precision mechanism
doing like half precision and half crude will be a middle ground quality
all crude will obviously be crude
yeag exactly
and it is affected by crafting medium still
like, a basic crafting table will be crude
wheras an assembly machine would be advanced
i also want some form of assemblyline process because i think in world crafting like that is cool

# resources
and yeah late game machinery will require lots of resources
which speaking of i want to add new ways to get resources
like....pretty much every tech mod just does "big miner that shits out ore" (no offense IE or excavator)
i want to do more interesting things than that


you could have the middle ground one be a chance between crude and precision actually, since that eliminates the annoying middle tiers
once again think precision mechanisms (from create this time)
except instead of the goofy hand it is different robot arms


you keep having the same ideas i did
like there would be one to add a block, one for welding or soldering, etc


specifically i was thinking you'd have to equip the arms with different tools like weld yea
lmao
this is also good
i was thinking i wanted   tiers though


yea   tiers works, just don't go beyond that
like an "early game" "mid game" and "late game"
yeah i do not want like   billion tiers that sounds annoying
is plenty


  generally gives a nice progression from like, earlygame to midgame to lategame
yes
early mid game you are still probably making a lot of crudes
late mid game, a lot of advanced
or hm
thinking on how quality would work as far as initial material production
quality will begin with the sheets you roll
unless i make it RNG which is...
bleh
well okay recipes that are like   % crude and   % advanced would have an RNG chance to be either maybe
that way there are only   outputs
which is not an overwhelming amount of unstackable items
you as the player would be encouraged to like, split them into their different categories as well


i'd say tie the raw material quality to the process fully
so you can use crude ones for things you do not need to have work super well


so there's no RNG until you start refining the materials
like....quality for ores?
or just
oh you mean no quality for basic components


basically, plate is plate
yeah


but when you cut it into gears it can be crude or precise or whatever
so is wire wire
should gear be gear


but when you cut it into gears it can be crude or precise or whatever
okay yeag that works


wires i think are fine as wire, since those are very basic and there's not much to be high or low quality there
mhm


irl wire quality is usually more down to material choices than the process
gears are more complex so it makes sense for them to have quality
yeah i like that
i am considering a sort of recycling system as well
only for basic components though
like you can melt down gears and wires
and the skeletons of plates
because i intend for that to be a system
it will not be plate -> gear
it will be plate -> gear & remains of plate
which you could just dump into a chest or throw into lava


i'd abstract that to just like
Steel/Copper/Whatever Scrap
but you could also take the time to set up some logistics
and squeeze more resources out


i'd abstract that to just like Steel/Copper/Whatever Scrap
yeah, good idea


as for The Ore Generator you mentioned, i actually had an idea you might like for that
oh?


basically, because actually quarrying is a pain in the arse to implement which is why only Create really does it; but something like the IE excavator feels a bit.. weird, since it just spawns ores out of nothing

so why not embrace that and have you drill ores out of bedrock?
bedrock ores


basically, have a multiblock drill you have to place on bedrock, which requires things like cooling and lubrication and such to run, and spits out ores

possibly regionally, kinda like the IE excavator


since that keeps the vibe more intact since it feels like the ores are actually coming from somewhere rather than thin air
on one hand yes i like that 
a few issues 
) having to place it on bedrock means that the machine will probably be hidden deep underground and never seen
1) it ends up feeling very samey....regional variance is good, but you still get every ore from the same method of "stick drill on rock"

which okay now that i think about it yeah that is kinda how we mine stuff irl....
except is is more like "send thousands of tons of dirt and rock to get purified"
actually yeah that probably works fine and this is me being dumb
i might still keep in the uranium from seawater thing though


yea the visuals are actually part of why it would require a bunch of support stuff for lube and coolant and such


since that encourages making a more permanent mining setup underground


alterantively it could be like the IP pumpjack where it can be on the surface but will drill a hole to bedrock
that works too
either way works, i just want models to be like an important part of the mod
and having this cool machine model shoved in a hole underground is, yk
but yeah i do like that idea
regonally based patches of "bedrock ore"
howsabout rather than giving the ore it gives like....something you need to further process


yeah, i think it's a non-issue though if you can incentivise a more permanent setup underground with for example the ores working like Factorio oil where you get diminishing returns but with an infinite supply
OH I LIKE THAT
yeah my issue with IE excavators is that they are not infinite


same
and unlike factorio or something you cannot just
go make a mining outpost several thousand blocks away
and ship stuff via train
because chunkloading go brrrr


it kinda disincentivises building cool stuff around them, since you'll just end up removing the excavator later anyway at which point your build is fucked

↩️
Reply to  yeah my issue with IE excavators is that they are not infinite
yeag
that as well
it becomes
excavator
silo(s)
nothing else
yeah i love the idea of a big drill
takes a lot of power, coolant, lube, maybe even new drillbits (think IE's arc furnace)
i think that maybe rather than spitting out chunks of raw ore ot could give you a different "raw bedrock ore"
which has options
you can either just, use it as a nornal chunk of raw ore (smelt it, crush it, whatever)
or run it through a processing line
like washing it, centrifuging it, etc.
which would give you more byproducts
and maybe more overall ore yield too


alternatively some kind of mineral gravel stuff


where you have to wash it to get out raw ore, i think centrifuging is a bit too many steps
okayy fair enough lol


since mining->washing->crushing->smelting->casting is already quite the chain
yeah, true
but it will not be mandatory to wash it
you can just do it for more yield
if you really want you can throw the ore gravel straight into a crusher, it just gives less
hmm
at the same time it is
literally just water and a machine
which is not expensive at all, epsecially considering you just set up this giant mining drill


honestly yea crushing is probably enough
okay idea
washing gives you some clay as a byproduct
so it gives you a way to automate clay
or just not have a washing step but i think it would be fun
which  if there is washing i will just uh
not have it output dirty water
since water in MC is infinite (yayyyy /s) and   % of players would not bother purifying it, and just void it and bring in new water
which speaking of, water!!
there will be pumps
pumps will be biome specific
they will only work in river or ocean biomes
so that you cannot just make a  x  pool and have infinite water from it


it kinda disincentivises building cool stuff around them, since you'll just end up removing the excavator later anyway at which point your build is fucked

there will be pumps
pumps will be biome specific
they will only work in river or ocean biomes
so that you cannot just make a  x  pool and have infinite water from it


ehh i'm not entirely sure i like that, i think i'd instead just check for a big enough volume of water


so you need like at least n blocks of water around the pump to produce water
i was considering that but it seems....hard
to implement


eh, i don't think it's that bad
in that case sure
i will go with that


i think you could just do a BFS on the pump at set intervals to scan the connected water blocks
like, ig it would need to check at every x interval
maybe every   seconds?  /tick would be super laggy
and i need to set a cap on the area it checks so it does not try to scan a whole fucking ocean and lag the game to death
and it also needs to distinguish, in the area, what water blocks it is actually connected to and what water blocks are part of another pool
like if it scans a  x x , and there are two pools in the area, how does it distinguish


yea just cut off the search once it hits the threshold


also BFS inherently needs a connected volume
keep in mind i know next to nothing about MC modding so maybe some of this is a lot easier than i think


since you scan every water block around the pump, add them to a list, then check all the neighbours of those not yet on the list and add them to the list, etc.


so if the water is not continuous the search won't propagate
okay yeah that seems reasonable to implement
how many water source blocks is reasonable...


idk,   ?    ?
i am thinking like 

just to keep the whole "factor of  " thing minecraft does


   is     which is a bit ridiculous, but yea i'd do somewhere between    and   
 works
but.

or   
you will need
there will
be biome specific pumps
because i want nuclear reactors!!!
and you WILL set those up near oceans or rivers
because i am tired of someone powering a whole fucking nuclear plant off of a  × ×  puddle


i think it's good enough if you limit pumps so that if there's multiple within the same    block water volume they split their output
ooooo yes


but if they can each hit    unique water blocks then they can coexist
stops players from spamming   pumps over the same pool
yeag
i like that
pumps will give like
mb/t maybe


nah that's way too much


remember that a tick is  /  th of a second, and that's a whole-ass bucket
i could also add a later game pump, similar to the ore drill (not useable for nuclear reactors still)
a groundwater pump
uhh
mb/t?
that seems....reasonable


maybe yeah
i need a flowrate limiter


anyway i wouldn't try to distinguish nuclear reactors by pump, that just sounds like implementation pain and player confusion waiting to h en
they justification will be that


because you'd basically need a special "reactor water" which is just annoying
"these are larger, more powerful pumps"
"which you need to draw enough water for the reactor"
de-aerated water, yes


at which point it becomes too convoluted imo
it does?


water types in games are pretty much invariably annoying and convoluted


especially with minecraft's jank fluid system
mhhh, i suppose...


and players most likely won't know what the fuck a de-aerated water is
i forget not everyone is a dork like me
bwäh
fine
okay secondary idea


i think it'd be better to just have the reactor draw a shitload of water, which can be supplied with regular pumps, but you'd need a ton of them and it makes more sense to have a large pump which checks a bigger area for water sources
there are   pumps
pump  )   mb/t
smol pump
ok it is
pretty much what you jusr said lol


i also wouldn't tie pumps to biomes because biomes are also kinda jank, and sometimes oceans can extend in non-ocean biomes; so your best bet is checking for more source blocks
pump  ) is a big girl and draws a lot more
ik biomes can be jank but generally i would like to think players would set it up in a way that makes sense
i could always just check to see if there is water under the pump
so players cannot set it up on land or whatever
because if i want a very lorg pump for nuclear reactors, the amount of blocks it would check would be like
   or something massive
at which point, lag could h en
i want the player to be encouraged to set up their NPPs near massive bodies of water


you could lie to the player
basically check for continuous water on each axis of the pump, and if their sum is enough, produce water


and then claim in the manual that it checks a volume
mhh, yeah i suppose? but people would probably figure that out
and cheese it


yeah but players will cheese everything, at a certain point you just have to stop caring
bwääägh 
i guess...
okayyy
lorg pump can just do that


because regardless of what you do the kind of players who datamine IE for exact values will hyperoptimise your mod too


you just have to make the cheese not obvious, which is enough to dissuade your actual target audience from going for it
i also got exact values for IE but i tested ingame instead of datamining
you are right
okayyy thicque pump will just do that


maybe add diagonals too so it feels more like an actual volume
i want to have like
cooling towers as well
so you can cycle water through the system again
but what benefit?
water is infinite
pumps will be running regardless
which sucks becausr i want giant cooling towers but also most players would just void the water you get back
and keep pumping
yeah, that would be good
i will figure out exact amounts later


i'd advice against cooling towers


they're a pain in the arse to get looking good in minecraft
...okay true


either you'll end up with an awkward out of place model like the one i made years ago for Immersive Tech, or it has to be built from blocks which is hard to implement nicely
shudders in immersive technology cooling tower


as for pumps, if you check something like this you could actually make it Extra Efficient with this one funny technology known as
Image


ray tracing
but other mods do


do you care if other mods fuck your balance with a fluid void?
yeah but as you said, they will look out of place


because chances are those mods are like, single magic cube mods, and so you won't be balanced in relation to them anyway
true


kinda the same issue IE has
IE does not add a fluid void but you can just break tanks so actually it does


yeah but that requires manual intervention so like, whatever
i try to avoid that as well
creosote is the main offender of filling tanks


anyway, as for trayracing, that wasn't even a joke
but i just diesel generator it
no it is a good idea
i did not think you were joking


good
bouncing back to this
like....
aaaaargh


anyway, i guess one way to make tanks not be entirely fluid voids is to check the fullness percentage and replace blocks with liquid sources on break based on it
oh goddess


so if you were to break a half-full IE tank, it still voids most of the fluid, but replaces   % of the tank with fluid sources


because, well, you broke a tank with a ton of liquid in it, the fuck did you expect would h en?
yeah that is good
alternatively tanks retain their fluid when broken and drop as a block
hm no
i like in world crafting of machines
and unless tanks are like
crafted in inventory that would not work
so it voids your fluid but also half of your tank x 
i like that


nah i was thinking it'd just drop the blocks the tank is made of as items
oh
i mean yeag that works too
in the case of lava it voids half of your tank x 
even then it is not a huge issue
as you said it requires player intervention


yeah
for automation it is not viable
and automation will be encouraged
strongly encouraged, even


and considering how many people keep asking for ways to automate arc furnace electrodes at regular intervals, requiring manual intervention is a pretty good way to incentivise proper automation
yeag
which
yeah i might just need steam to get consumed
as much as I want a giant tower spewing steam particles
it would be hard to do in a minecraft style
even if i leaned more towards like
chornobyl style cooling towers, instead of the more modern ones


you could have a gas vent that is basically a fluid void with extra steps and only for upside down fluids like steam; and if you require either sky access or n air blocks above it, then the particles alone incentivise doing something cool with it
cooling towers are lorg cylinder
hard to do in MC


which, in the case of NPP, people will naturally gravitate towards some form of cooling tower build because that looks cool
yeag
true
i would just say sky access


because you'll have a thing spitting out particles anyway, and those who are doing yard sard are going to not bother regardless


sky access i'd also say is good
it would pretty much only work for steam
because i intend for other gasses like the aforementioned oxygen
and nitrogen and blah blah blah


i mean it might as well work for those too, they can be pretty safely vented and it's not like there's much incentive to do so
yeah but then we get into particle shenanigans
like,


only have particles if it's steam; problem solved
okay
yeah lol
that works
okay i like thissss
as far as other methods of power generation go
probably a windmill for early game
waterwheel too, at risk of copying IE and create
i want a boiler of some form for midgame power 
probably just a coal powered boiler
which will also let you use the steam/gas vent
i could maybe do photovoltaics of some sort as well??


honestly


i'd not do waterwheels


too easy to exploit because Minecraft water
true actually
windmills early on is fine


my take is go wind as the earlygame source, then bigger wind as well as basic steam as the late earlygame and early midgame  thing
basic steam as in like
a steam engine


like, inefficient very crude steam engines
and then proper midgame is
turbines
and larger boilers
lategame is nuclear ofc


and then you could make a better steam engine with like proper valve gear and the like which would be the proper midgame thing
i am debating adding petrochem and plastics and whatnot


i think turbines should be like, late midgame early lategame, optimised primarily for nuclear but you could run them with high pressure boilers too


i'd suggest yes to petrochem, mostly because there's some really fun manufacturing processes and fluid management there
which would let you have ICEs
for power


it's one of my favourite parts about Factorio for a reason
yeah i will do like
simplified petrochem
some plastics, some fuels
nothing too complex


ICEs i'd suggest as a sort of outpost power source; less output than steam, but you can move the fuel around endlessly and easily in barrels and such
outpost power and also backup


so it makes sense for example for powering a mining outpost, or your nether base or whatever
yeah


and yea backup
i need to work nuclear reactors to require backup in some way
just because i think system redundancies are cool and fun


that's kinda the hard part about nuclear reactors
they should be a sort of risk-reward thing for the Vibes™️, but also they're so hilariously safe irl that it's hard to do that
yeah


and if you have something like needing automatic SCRAM on overheat, that's just an easily copy-pasted setup with some redstone and doesn't require actual thinking
i mean the best i can think is a heat buildup system
so you need to take reactor to a low output mode periodically
let it cool down


actually i have An Idea


make the control rods adjustable with redstone or a computer or something


that way there's two main paths
yeah they will be adjustable
absolutely
	
or ig       
% insertion


you can either have a setup that waits for the thing to get hot, then SCRAMs, which is the simple solution for players who don't want to do too complex stuff

but then if you want to optimise them, you'd have to build a circuit that tries to keep the thing at an optimal temperature range
yeah, i like that
also fully shutting down the reactor is bad™
since it stops the flow of neutrons
and you have to put in some effort to get the reactor started again


i'd also maybe Not have a real meltdown mechanic, maybe instead have the SCRAM be builtin to reactors


mostly because it's bloody impossible to implement in a fun way
meltdowns are...yeag
⚡Emma/Emera, the S hire Storm⚡ PIPE 
scram
⚡Emma/Emera, the S hire Storm⚡ PIPE 
now I'm thinking about scrambled eggs
⚡Emma/Emera, the S hire Storm⚡ PIPE 
could go for those rn


you'd basically need a radiation mechanic for it to be interesting, and only NuclearCraft has done that
either "blow the fuck up" (unrealistic)
or "make chunks unlivable"


yeah
NTM has one too
but if i do a radiation system i am using grays not rads
idk why they all use rads


Fallout
those are not for person contamination
i have never played fallout but that makes sense


Fallout popularised idea of rads as unit, so now in popular culture rads are just The Radiation Unit(TM)
ah
i mean i am tempted to do a radiation system
like.....
i really want to


i guess one way to do it would be to have you start gaining status effects when in proximity to radiation sources, but not pollute chunks


and take measures to make the sources unvoidable, so you're incentivised to bury them near bedrock or hide them far away
finland pit reference no way
⚡Emma/Emera, the S hire Storm⚡ PIPE 
pit?


more like cavity or hole
onkalo


it's basically a great hole we digged where earth's pores didn't suffice


so we can stick nuclear waste in there
yeag
much better than whatever the fuck the US is doing with waste pilot plant


still not Francesque reprocessing but yea
mhm
this works maybe


the hard part is making radiation-producing items undisposable
things like concrete or water could additionally reduce stuff
make them like netherite stuff
they do not burn
and some way for them to not despawn


not despawning is lag hell because you'll end up with a gajillion entities


i guess you could have every radiation-producing item have a block form, and instead of despawning they convert to that
well, then store your fucking nuclear waste properly /lh 
throwing them out of your inventory turns them into block upon landing, makes sense
the block would have to be explosion immune though


true, but that's not hard to do


or you could have it always drop from explosions, after which it just re-places itself  þ
yeah
lmao
yeah true
i also kinda want chunk contamination though


anyway this is one reason i probably won't have item entities in my minecraft clone if i make that; if you want to do anything interesting with them, it leads to a lag nightmare
yeah


i personally disagree with everything chunk-based, since without cubic chunks it gets a bit dumb
so melting down your reactor actually has consequences


and also then you'd need a chunk cleanup mechanic and that's just annoying
yeag you are right


i think melting your expensive-ass reactor and having to dispose of the corium is consequence enough
i am thinking of how to implement radiation then
yeah but then likr....as soon as you mine the corium it all goes back to normal?
it is a videogame
that is finr actually


yea


you're not making reactor meltdown simulator       þ
i will not go down the realism > gameplay rabbithole
okay so then how to do radiation
hrmmm


on the note of the control system, i think you basically need a computer or logic unit mechanic of some kind though

because otherwise you encourage some shitty-looking vanilla redstone spaghetti for controlling your rods
yeah, i agree


as for radiation, i'd just check proximity to radiation-emitting blocks as well as items in inventory, if those are present start adding stacks of radiation poisoning
but what proximity


idk, a few blocks?
only a few blocks??


maybe like,     or so? that would essentially render the area of a chunk dangerous, but not require a chunk contamination mechanic
  is good yeah
maybe for corium i would make it    or something


remember that scales in minecraft are relatively tiny so it shouldn't be like, a massive area


   already means it's a chunk in each direction, so at least a     volume
natural uranium will be safe


as for implementation
i could maybe add PUREX as well
i want some form of fuel reprocessing


for blocks i think i'd keep a map of locations grouped by chunk for efficiency


so you don't need to continuously scan around the player, and don't need every radiation source to be a blockentity


and can instead check the nearest  x  or  x  of chunks in the map, and compare the player position to the source positions
h u h


and when a source is removed or placed, add or remove its location from that map
so like
it compares the player's position to a preestablished map of the chunk?


a map as in the data structure
ohg
lol


anyway then again you probably would also just get away with BEs with how few sources there probably will be
yeah i doubt there will be much
i will need to find a way to like 
make chests radioactive though
assuming they have strong radioisotopes in them


mixin on containers should work
as for power
we discussed sources
transmission.


IE style wires, obviously


maybe bus bars or wall-mount LV wires for interior wiring
i was thinking a combination of IE type wiring for long distance, and then cables for shorter distances


mm, i suppose?


also i think i'd do a separate alternating flux style thing for long distances


where you have like no losses but need special multiblock transformers to connect to regular power
i like that
i also want like...
sort of like create
you have both voltage and amperage
but that will
not interface with mods using RF
which is Bad
so i will probably just have one unit of
measurement


honestly i'd just do a custom energy system

no, that channel is clearly for other purposes /s   


you won't be balanced with Forgestone Flunergy anyway, so might as well give yourself the freedom to do what oyu want
yeah
but like
what about a converter
because people would want that
whether it be EU to HE
sdjkSGKASDF
EU to IF


people also want a converted between Create SU and FE
i just realised EU are already a thing
nvbmmmmm


doesn't mean they're getting one without making an addon
my brain said "yes energy unit"
oh hello gregtech


also IC 


anyway
ic 
yeah


i have a suggestion


as for pumps, if you check something like this you could actually make it Extra Efficient with this one funny technology known as
Image


ray tracing
but other mods do


do you care if other mods fuck your balance with a fluid void?
yeah but as you said, they will look out of place


because chances are those mods are like, single magic cube mods, and so you won't be balanced in relation to them anyway
true


kinda the same issue IE has
IE does not add a fluid void but you can just break tanks so actually it does


yeah but that requires manual intervention so like, whatever
i try to avoid that as well
creosote is the main offender of filling tanks


anyway, as for trayracing, that wasn't even a joke
but i just diesel generator it
no it is a good idea
i did not think you were joking


good
bouncing back to this
like....
aaaaargh


anyway, i guess one way to make tanks not be entirely fluid voids is to check the fullness percentage and replace blocks with liquid sources on break based on it
oh goddess


so if you were to break a half-full IE tank, it still voids most of the fluid, but replaces   % of the tank with fluid sources


because, well, you broke a tank with a ton of liquid in it, the fuck did you expect would h en?
yeah that is good
alternatively tanks retain their fluid when broken and drop as a block
hm no
i like in world crafting of machines
and unless tanks are like
crafted in inventory that would not work
so it voids your fluid but also half of your tank x 
i like that


nah i was thinking it'd just drop the blocks the tank is made of as items
oh
i mean yeag that works too
in the case of lava it voids half of your tank x 
even then it is not a huge issue
as you said it requires player intervention


yeah
for automation it is not viable
and automation will be encouraged
strongly encouraged, even


and considering how many people keep asking for ways to automate arc furnace electrodes at regular intervals, requiring manual intervention is a pretty good way to incentivise proper automation
yeag
which
yeah i might just need steam to get consumed
as much as I want a giant tower spewing steam particles
it would be hard to do in a minecraft style
even if i leaned more towards like
chornobyl style cooling towers, instead of the more modern ones


you could have a gas vent that is basically a fluid void with extra steps and only for upside down fluids like steam; and if you require either sky access or n air blocks above it, then the particles alone incentivise doing something cool with it
cooling towers are lorg cylinder
hard to do in MC


which, in the case of NPP, people will naturally gravitate towards some form of cooling tower build because that looks cool
yeag
true
i would just say sky access


because you'll have a thing spitting out particles anyway, and those who are doing yard sard are going to not bother regardless


sky access i'd also say is good
it would pretty much only work for steam
because i intend for other gasses like the aforementioned oxygen
and nitrogen and blah blah blah


i mean it might as well work for those too, they can be pretty safely vented and it's not like there's much incentive to do so
yeah but then we get into particle shenanigans
like,


only have particles if it's steam; problem solved
okay
yeah lol
that works
okay i like thissss
as far as other methods of power generation go
probably a windmill for early game
waterwheel too, at risk of copying IE and create
i want a boiler of some form for midgame power 
probably just a coal powered boiler
which will also let you use the steam/gas vent
i could maybe do photovoltaics of some sort as well??


honestly


i'd not do waterwheels


too easy to exploit because Minecraft water
true actually
windmills early on is fine


my take is go wind as the earlygame source, then bigger wind as well as basic steam as the late earlygame and early midgame  thing
basic steam as in like
a steam engine


like, inefficient very crude steam engines
and then proper midgame is
turbines
and larger boilers
lategame is nuclear ofc


and then you could make a better steam engine with like proper valve gear and the like which would be the proper midgame thing
i am debating adding petrochem and plastics and whatnot


i think turbines should be like, late midgame early lategame, optimised primarily for nuclear but you could run them with high pressure boilers too


i'd suggest yes to petrochem, mostly because there's some really fun manufacturing processes and fluid management there
which would let you have ICEs
for power


it's one of my favourite parts about Factorio for a reason
yeah i will do like
simplified petrochem
some plastics, some fuels
nothing too complex


ICEs i'd suggest as a sort of outpost power source; less output than steam, but you can move the fuel around endlessly and easily in barrels and such
outpost power and also backup


so it makes sense for example for powering a mining outpost, or your nether base or whatever
yeah


and yea backup
i need to work nuclear reactors to require backup in some way
just because i think system redundancies are cool and fun


that's kinda the hard part about nuclear reactors
they should be a sort of risk-reward thing for the Vibes™️, but also they're so hilariously safe irl that it's hard to do that
yeah


and if you have something like needing automatic SCRAM on overheat, that's just an easily copy-pasted setup with some redstone and doesn't require actual thinking
i mean the best i can think is a heat buildup system
so you need to take reactor to a low output mode periodically
let it cool down


actually i have An Idea


make the control rods adjustable with redstone or a computer or something


that way there's two main paths
yeah they will be adjustable
absolutely
	
or ig       
% insertion


you can either have a setup that waits for the thing to get hot, then SCRAMs, which is the simple solution for players who don't want to do too complex stuff

but then if you want to optimise them, you'd have to build a circuit that tries to keep the thing at an optimal temperature range
yeah, i like that
also fully shutting down the reactor is bad™
since it stops the flow of neutrons
and you have to put in some effort to get the reactor started again


i'd also maybe Not have a real meltdown mechanic, maybe instead have the SCRAM be builtin to reactors


mostly because it's bloody impossible to implement in a fun way
meltdowns are...yeag
⚡Emma/Emera, the S hire Storm⚡ PIPE 
scram
⚡Emma/Emera, the S hire Storm⚡ PIPE 
now I'm thinking about scrambled eggs
⚡Emma/Emera, the S hire Storm⚡ PIPE 
could go for those rn


you'd basically need a radiation mechanic for it to be interesting, and only NuclearCraft has done that
either "blow the fuck up" (unrealistic)
or "make chunks unlivable"


yeah
NTM has one too
but if i do a radiation system i am using grays not rads
idk why they all use rads


Fallout
those are not for person contamination
i have never played fallout but that makes sense


Fallout popularised idea of rads as unit, so now in popular culture rads are just The Radiation Unit(TM)
ah
i mean i am tempted to do a radiation system
like.....
i really want to


i guess one way to do it would be to have you start gaining status effects when in proximity to radiation sources, but not pollute chunks


and take measures to make the sources unvoidable, so you're incentivised to bury them near bedrock or hide them far away
finland pit reference no way
⚡Emma/Emera, the S hire Storm⚡ PIPE 
pit?


more like cavity or hole
onkalo


it's basically a great hole we digged where earth's pores didn't suffice


so we can stick nuclear waste in there
yeag
much better than whatever the fuck the US is doing with waste pilot plant


still not Francesque reprocessing but yea
mhm
this works maybe


the hard part is making radiation-producing items undisposable
things like concrete or water could additionally reduce stuff
make them like netherite stuff
they do not burn
and some way for them to not despawn


not despawning is lag hell because you'll end up with a gajillion entities


i guess you could have every radiation-producing item have a block form, and instead of despawning they convert to that
well, then store your fucking nuclear waste properly /lh 
throwing them out of your inventory turns them into block upon landing, makes sense
the block would have to be explosion immune though


true, but that's not hard to do


or you could have it always drop from explosions, after which it just re-places itself  þ
yeah
lmao
yeah true
i also kinda want chunk contamination though


anyway this is one reason i probably won't have item entities in my minecraft clone if i make that; if you want to do anything interesting with them, it leads to a lag nightmare
yeah


i personally disagree with everything chunk-based, since without cubic chunks it gets a bit dumb
so melting down your reactor actually has consequences


and also then you'd need a chunk cleanup mechanic and that's just annoying
yeag you are right


i think melting your expensive-ass reactor and having to dispose of the corium is consequence enough
i am thinking of how to implement radiation then
yeah but then likr....as soon as you mine the corium it all goes back to normal?
it is a videogame
that is finr actually


yea


you're not making reactor meltdown simulator       þ
i will not go down the realism > gameplay rabbithole
okay so then how to do radiation
hrmmm


on the note of the control system, i think you basically need a computer or logic unit mechanic of some kind though

because otherwise you encourage some shitty-looking vanilla redstone spaghetti for controlling your rods
yeah, i agree


as for radiation, i'd just check proximity to radiation-emitting blocks as well as items in inventory, if those are present start adding stacks of radiation poisoning
but what proximity


idk, a few blocks?
only a few blocks??


maybe like,     or so? that would essentially render the area of a chunk dangerous, but not require a chunk contamination mechanic
  is good yeah
maybe for corium i would make it    or something


remember that scales in minecraft are relatively tiny so it shouldn't be like, a massive area


   already means it's a chunk in each direction, so at least a     volume
natural uranium will be safe


as for implementation
i could maybe add PUREX as well
i want some form of fuel reprocessing


for blocks i think i'd keep a map of locations grouped by chunk for efficiency


so you don't need to continuously scan around the player, and don't need every radiation source to be a blockentity


and can instead check the nearest  x  or  x  of chunks in the map, and compare the player position to the source positions
h u h


and when a source is removed or placed, add or remove its location from that map
so like
it compares the player's position to a preestablished map of the chunk?


a map as in the data structure
ohg
lol


anyway then again you probably would also just get away with BEs with how few sources there probably will be
yeah i doubt there will be much
i will need to find a way to like 
make chests radioactive though
assuming they have strong radioisotopes in them


mixin on containers should work
as for power
we discussed sources
transmission.


IE style wires, obviously


maybe bus bars or wall-mount LV wires for interior wiring
i was thinking a combination of IE type wiring for long distance, and then cables for shorter distances


mm, i suppose?


also i think i'd do a separate alternating flux style thing for long distances


where you have like no losses but need special multiblock transformers to connect to regular power
i like that
i also want like...
sort of like create
you have both voltage and amperage
but that will
not interface with mods using RF
which is Bad
so i will probably just have one unit of
measurement


honestly i'd just do a custom energy system
