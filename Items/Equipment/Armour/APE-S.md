Armoured Personal Enhancement-Suits. 
Effectively, an advanced exoskeleton with peripheral augmentation. 

Despite bearing many similarities to [[MECH Units]] are legally and technically distinct, as they are always classified as BDD (solely extending the user‘s perception and action). 
	However, common lack of understanding led [[ORaNG-E-S]] to also be counted as APE-S’ BDD. 
APE-S find common use amongst infantry and civilians alike, but civilian use is unofficially restricted to industrial applications and other heavy duties.

Their construction is drastically limited by the constraint of following the form factor of a humanoid, which has innovated metallised exoskeletons and skin, exposed muscles and compound chitin plating. 
Operating an APE-S is primarily done via muscle tracking, which does not require invasive procedures or complex preparation, unlike ORCaGES. 
Only in newer models the APE-S establishes a direct link to the wearer via [[Standard Neural Interface]] and intravenous tethers to power the bio-actors and provide sensory interlinking.
