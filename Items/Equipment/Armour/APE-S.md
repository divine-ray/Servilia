Armoured Personal Equipment-Suits. 
Despite bearing many similarities to [[MECH Units]] are legally and technically distinct, as they are always classified as BDD (solely extending the userâ€˜s perception and action). 
APE-S find common use amongst infantry and civilians alike, but civilian use is unofficially restricted to industrial applications and other heavy duties.
Their construction is drastically limited by the constraint of following the form factor of a humanoid, which has innovated metallised exoskeletons and skin, exposed muscles and compound chitin plating. 
In the majority of models, the APE-S establishes a direct link to the wearer via [[Standard Neural Interface]] and intravenous tethers to power the bioactors and provide sensory interlinking.
