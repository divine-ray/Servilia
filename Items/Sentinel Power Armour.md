#equipment #Thylyist #Old 

A finely crafted armour, driven by clockwork and steam. With a steady supply of energy it becomes a truly intimidating piece of machinery on the battlefield.

Sentinel power amour, stolen from the [[Central Thylyist Armoury]]. One of the most powerful and strongest marvels of contemporary Thylyian technology. Highly modular and customisable, plead for a hearing with the [[War Constructors]] for upgrades and modification. 

Any person not associated to the Followers are not seen as sainted and worthy to wear such technology, but in secret, it is simply too valuable and powerful in the hands of a civilian. Through this, the Vanguard will pursue anyone in suspicion of War Constructor equipment and retrieve their assets by all means, including [[The Hounds]].
