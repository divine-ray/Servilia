Spirit-infused alloy which only is visible during any first quarter to last quarter of the moons or under intense light, which we have not been able to achieve outside of complex focusing optics and the circumstances in a forge.

Highly valued and hunted-for amongst assassins and other shady folk that is active at night-time. It is rumoured that only a dozen kilos or less made it off the Ka√°-Rav isles into the Servilian Mainland.
Typically drawn or wrought into fine wire and foil to inscribe secret information aside from its excellent use in armour plating. A more recent secondary use of inscription using Ithildine has arisen for hiding runes and sigils in blank sight.

Only those attuned to the [[Lunatics|astral]] seem to be able to recreate this peculiar substance, with yields best around a triple newmoon. 

Speculated to consist out of [[Bottle of Dreams|dream essence]]/liquid starlight fused onto hastelloy by outsiders, with its composition and recipes kept under highest secrecy.
