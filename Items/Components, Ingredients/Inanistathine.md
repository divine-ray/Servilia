*From Latin “Inanis” = nothing (adj.)*<br>
A metal(?), pitch black, deeper and darker than the night and the deepest depths of the ocean.
It seems to be convulsing, yes, shaking. 
Bringing light to it seems feeble, as no torch, no candle, can fight its gluttony for light. 
Shadows seem to grow longer and act strangely in proximity to a bar of this. 
What as this? Is this what pure darkness looks like, instilled upon metal?
Did some fool try and succeed with turning [[The Void|nothing]] into something?
It eludes touch, shaping itself away, fleeting into liquid like wretched quicksilver.

Working this beast of a material is nigh impossible using conventional measures of hearth and hammer. Possibly it’s evasion could be used against itself…
