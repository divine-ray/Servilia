A sharp, pointed fragment, apparently broken or struck off a larger crystal.
Reddish-orange in tone, much like the faint glow flickering within. 
This flickering frequently but irregularly flares up, enough to be blinding to an observer and emits an intense heat during such a flare. 
Ash, soot and other dusts have been baked or sintered to its surface from this heat. 

It’s unpredictable nature makes it fairly difficult to handle.
Someone interested in high temperature applications might find this valuable. 

%%Can be sold to the CoTF, possibly to upgrade bottled embers/smoulders%%
