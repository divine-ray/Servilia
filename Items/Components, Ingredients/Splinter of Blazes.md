A searing hot splinter, seemingly struck off from a larger reddish crystal.
There is a thin coating of ash sintered onto it.
Streaks of yellow-orangey tones flicker within, much like a flame contained. 

Despite being extremely hot, you can hold it like any other item.

Someone interested in high temperature applications might find this valuable. 

%%Can be sold to the CoTF, possibly to upgrade bottled embers/smoulders%%
