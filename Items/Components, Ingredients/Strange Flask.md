This bottle is carved out of beryllium bronze with a cork/plug cut from fiery ruby.
Its metal body is engraved with detailed runes and other arcane writing, which are warm to the touch. 

Vessels like these are rather common containers for all kinds of magical or otherwise volatile substances, with the engravings and gem plug depending on the content.
