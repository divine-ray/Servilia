Those for whom the bell tolls shall never see each other again, their connections and tethers severed. 
Brass body, grooved ornaments filled with blood of a divided lover. 
Yet, it tolls for everyone mourning, yearning and loving. 
Nobody has ever heard this bell with their own ears but they have felt it.
For it is the only remaining bell of the [[Clocktowers beneath the Sea]]; it rings no more, lest screams and toils unheard by Man throughout the seas. 

Local fishermen have become able to predict catastrophes like failing harvests, famines and bad weather from the fish around the sunken cities.
