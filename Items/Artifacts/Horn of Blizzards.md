The wind is blowing on these cold, cold grounds.
My boots are a-roaming on these cold, cold lands.
From every mountain peak that I see echoes off the horn. 
May the [[Empire of Winds]] keep us safe and sound.
Are we worthy of the empire of winds?
The storms are overwhelming, but we keep on climbing, 
In order to be worthy of the empire of winds!
My Ears are hurting, but we keep on pushing.
The noise of the blizzard is overwhelming, yet we keep onwards.
***
A colossal horn of a long-dead species, under control of the Empire of Winds. 
One delegate of their most shamanistic tribes is tasked with keeping the Horn active and thus partakes in the upkeep of the blizzards within the [[Northern Reaches]].
