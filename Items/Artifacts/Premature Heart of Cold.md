A lump of frozen necrotic tissue, eerily shaped to resemble a slowly beating heart. 
Its severed, open arteries struggle to pump air, which leaves this lump noticeably colder than the environment. <br>
The surface is frozen-cold to the touch, enough to cover itself with most peculiar ice patterns. These patterns present entirely different habits, as though normal surface ice. Staring too long at these patterns causes an almost hypnotic pull, transferring the freezing temperatures within the heart unto the observer. 


***

Someone must have taken a tissue sample from the Cold, which shaped itself into this intriguing heart.

Upon contact with the body of any higher organism, may it be dead or alive, it spreads out tendril-like veins, starting to bury itself in the body, shuffling the insides without care to replace the heart.
