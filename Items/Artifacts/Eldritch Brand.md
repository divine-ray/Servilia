The brand of the [[Voidfish]], slowly carving out the unfortunate body it has been placed upon. 
It oozes, which seems to attempt to lash onto anything it grabs. 
The ooze, black as night, darker than anything. 

This should be the key to the Limbo Boneyard.

When carrying, the image of the Great Old One will engrave itself into the user, giving +2 fixed insanity after 1 week in game.

This mental branding is building a immunity (50%) to future insanity.

To Access the Void, the Eldritch Brand is required.
Upon meeting the Void itself, the Brand will be ripped off the bearer, leaving them with a massive wound from the removal.

> **Origin:** *Great Old One.* This item was created by an eldritch abomination from the cosmos or ocean depths, or a cultist or warlock of such a being. Its appearance incorporates eyes, tentacles, mouths, and beaks, some of which might move on their own or whisper horrible gibbering sounds. Whatever its powers, they are great and terrible. Anyone using this item risks losing their mind, and few are brave or foolish enough to do so.
