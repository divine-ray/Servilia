When carrying, the image of the Great Old One will engrave itself into the user, giving +2 fixed insanity after 1 week in game.

This mental branding is building a immunity (50%) to future insanity.

To Access the Void, the Eldritch Brand is required.
Upon meeting the Void itself, the Brand will be ripped off the bearer, leaving them with a massive wound from the removal.
