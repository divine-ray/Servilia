Powerful objects, made as fanciful hook, line and sinker, do drag down below the fools, the unwise and the greedy. Power, wealth and other promises float and flicker on the surface, leading to the trap, one which eventually turns fatal.
Promises be granted, lest they take their price in rates of interest, turning, twisting the one who fell for it.
One who [[Clocktowers beneath the Sea|wants to ring the bells]] may do so with the striker, but only once, for it will consume them. Lest; the [[Division Bell|bells]] call forth woe, they cause wake in those that shall be left slumbering, heard in places that are not ours. 

Here, listen. For I bestow upon you the [[Empty Crown]], as you earned it duly. Set out to become a great monarch. Always remember the price you paid. What you owe me, them, everyone but yourself.
