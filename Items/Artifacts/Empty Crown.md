The crown said to once be worn by His Majesty, the [[King Erl the Yellow]].
It granted him his legendary longevity.
At which costâ€¦
His Majesty had to bargain with the Flesh-Twisters to stop his bones and flesh from fleeting another; King Erl fell apart, lost limbs and legs when left without His Lifeline, The Empty Crown. 

Its name is misleading, the Crown itself is not empty. It is full, full of the lives it consumed, of previous ascendants, forgotten rulers and toppled monarchs. 
The Emptiness is what becomes of those who dare to take it on, those who delude themselves to believe their strength over this artifact.
