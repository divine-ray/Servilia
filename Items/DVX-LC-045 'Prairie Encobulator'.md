A recent project of the [[Linguistics and Communication]] faculty within Duley in cooperation with the Workshop and the Engineering Faculty has resulted in a novel device, serial number DVX-LC-045, dubbed "Prairie Encobulator". The DVX-LC-045 acts as translator-encoder device capable of encoding human messages and translating those into a format compatible with the [[Praries]], which have subsequently seen swift adaptation and domestication as messengers for telegram sized messages. 
It primarily operates on experimental auditive arco-technology^[arcane technology] capable of processing human speech without the need for a complex mechanical input device, greatly easing manufacturing and further development.
