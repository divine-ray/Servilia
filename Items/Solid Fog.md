A unit of solidified fog, extracted from a [[Thin Veil]]. It's greyish white in appearance and seems to evade touch, despite it repeatedly jamming machinery and trains.  It appears that living people and animals alike are unable to interact with it, while being hard as rock to common steel tools.
No applications of this peculiar substance are currently known, but research is being conducted.
it poses a notable bother and struggle to railroad operations passing through veins as it has the potential to damage and destroy steam engines.
