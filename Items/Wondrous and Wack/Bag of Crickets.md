A Bag of Holding, specifically tailored to hold a near-infinite amount of crickets to release unto a foe. Comes with 100,000 crickets from the get-go!
Someone with a taste for smaller insects might accept them instead of currency. 
The population of crickets within is self-contained, and only relies on regular inputs of water and some food. Well, *some.*

***Disrupt the local ecosystem for the low price of 22.99â‚¬!***
