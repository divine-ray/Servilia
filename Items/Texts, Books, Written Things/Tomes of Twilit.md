## The Ways of using Amarisk 
A large, locked coffer made from hardened steel, adorned with silver dragon scales.
It is filled to the brim with plain, leather-bound scriptures.
Each of these smaller books appears to be covered in a slight ethereal haze, which grows thicker if the books are moved haphazardly or read too quickly.

### Requirements
For a individual to be able to conduct and weave Twilit into elementary forces, one must:
- Be capable of conducting Twilit through inputs and [outlets](Spellcasting%20Glove.md). 
- Conduct Twilit in a way that does not cause too much/too little resistance.
	- Having a too low resistance will conduct *too much* Twilit into the Woven, causing unforeseen spell reactions.
	- Having a too high resistance will cause the caster's body to physically heat up, damaging their body, possibly causing death. 
- Have a good standing with the invoked spirit/force.

To channel twilit and shape it into a Woven, the confined spell, one must provide means for the energies to flow through oneself, commonly directing the inflow through receptacle-like implants and allowing the outflow through a implement that can shape the energies into the Woven, typically a glove. 
The receptacles currently employed are clunky, and are prone for causing unwanted attention. 
A common design, which has proven efficient enough, is a implant mounted into the shoulder or neck which consists of stacked "bowls" or dishes in a supporting structure.
