Through conception and planning; ideas refined, polished till perfection.
In [[Mekhane|His]] Image we plan, construct, assemble. 
Our [[Blessed Machine]] guides the way through [[Providence]] to [[Ascension]]. 
The flesh will spoil, rot, nothing but bones remain of the former self. 
	Yet, the newborn self remains driven by oxygen and blood, a heirloom and legacy of its origins. A stark warning to those...
The foul energies haunting our realm prevent one's spirit to depart, to migrate away. Nothing but this is cause to the strange behaviour of the deceased, as they remain fully cognisant.
