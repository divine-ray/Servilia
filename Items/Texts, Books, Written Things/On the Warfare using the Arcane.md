## Weaponized Wizardry
A collection of papers for massacre and violation using the arcane.  

This tome is written in luminous ink engraved into blackened glass plates, bound in black dragon scales. It is locked by a intangible mechanism, which seems to loosen partially depending on location. 
%%It only opens within the Archive of Old.%% 

Once unlocked, one may spend up to 8 hours per day studying it, which will each grant knowledge about taking magic onto the battlefield, such as a recipe, spell, or ritual. 
The tome holds knowledge for 34 greater cyphers, 56 lesser cyphers and 27 potions. 
%%Per hour of study, a D100 is rolled, and knowledge will be granted as follows:%%

D100 |  Knowledge 
 -- | --
 1-5 | Superior Cypher
 6-20 | Greater Cypher
 21-40 | Lesser Cypher
 41-69 | Potion
 70-100 | Spell
