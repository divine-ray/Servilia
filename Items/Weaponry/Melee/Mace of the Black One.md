**Weapon (mace)**

**Origin:** *Void.* This Item was forged by no other than [[Warlock Gaíz-an]], for itself to send out into the world and curse whatever poor soul finds it. It is an asymmetrical  clump of blackened iron, smeared paste, and it bears screaming faces and dark runes. Its powers may cause madness, undeath, deformation or maiming, disease, pain, decay, or something else horrible. It may also be capable of dirigating [[Night Runner|Night Runners]]. This item causes any non-[[Hollowed]] immense discomfort, and will inflict madness, disease, pain, death, or abyssal corruption on its user.

 

**Major Property:** *Astral.* This item has some connection to the astral plane, such as enabling its user to astrally project.

 

**Minor Property:** *Illusory Appearance.* Illusions mask this item\'s true form. Its user might be able to manipulate these illusions.
