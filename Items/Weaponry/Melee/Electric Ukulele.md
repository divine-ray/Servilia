*And his music was electric.*
Finest and most exotic wood, strung with exotic [metal](Inanistathine), but bearing smoulders, through which lightning bore its way through. An intangible static seems to surround this instrument, unimpeded by conductors or flesh in its proximity. 

### Stats

Metal armour may provide immunity against these attacks.
