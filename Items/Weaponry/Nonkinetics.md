In the advent of mobile, self-sustaining combat platforms (usually known as [[MECH Units]]), it became obvious that supplying consumable ammunition would eventually leave a ranged combat unit exposed and vulnerable, leading to losses.
To remedy this, research at APAS has led to the development of propellant-less weapon systems.
Introducing: Nonkinetics.

Most common in the contemporary battlefield are powerful laser beams, which occasionally also function as close-quarter-combat implements. 
Defying the definition but still classified as nonkinetics are electromagnetic weapons such as coilguns and gauss rifles. 
Heavier nonkinetics using particle beams are not suited for mobile combat platforms. Instead, they find applications in stationary fortifications and structures.
