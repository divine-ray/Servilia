%%basically one-time use spells, they loose function/self-destruct afterwards. compatible with ommoran firearms, especially the RCL0.%%
Greater cyphers simply loose their power after activation, lesser cyphers shatter or disintegrate. 
Superior cyphers may be used several times, but will discharge in a chain when force is acted upon it.
Greater cyphers may be "recharged" by re-applying their lost power/catalyst using a spell/ritual. Also applies for superior cyphers, as long as they remain intact. 

## Superior 
- A *smouldering*, raw shard of *bloody* ruby, with streaks of *glimmering embers* within it. Upon activation, it summons a fireball (6m sucessful dex save, 8d6 fire on fail, half on sucess) at either a desired or its own position (manual/thrown). It can cast up to eight fireballs before depletion. 
- A smooth and polished amber, containing a *tiny flame*.  Upon use, the amber turns ashen grey and a wall of inextinguishable flame emerges on the spot of activation, which can melt any metal. 
- A blueish-milky white icicle, with iridescent reflections playing on the surface. 
  Upon activation, it flash-freezes any substance until it's brittle in a radius of 3m. With each use, a centimetre of it melts away into common water, until the deep-frozen core at 15cm depletion remains (this equates to 5 uses).
## Greater 
- A dragon's claw engraved with *glowing* symbols. When activated, the cypher grants the target advantage on attack rolls until the end of their next turn.
- Grey Cypher:  A glass spindle filled with *silvery liquid*.  When broken over a weapon, the weapon is transmuted into a unknown metal.  It deals an additional 2d6 points of damage until the end of the session, after which the weapon disintegrates.
- A jagged shard of emerald containing a *flickering flame*. When impaled into flesh, the cypher melts into eternal fire that lasts for a day.
- A *broken* jade cube *warped by magic*. When thrown at a target, the cypher causes a small earthquake (knocked prone, Dex save negates).
- A copper fragment smeared with *crimson blood*. When launched at a target, the cypher explodes with a thunderous bang (3d6 thunder damage and deafened, Con save half and negates).
- A broken oaken staff *engraved with geometric patterns*. When held and activated, the cypher conjures a permanent wall of stone.
- Crystal Fragment:  A large fragment of an obsidian sphere, containing a *shifting cloud of light*.  When held and activated, the cypher allows you to scry an individual creature known by name. However, you can only see their face.
- A hydra's tooth engraved with *glowing symbols*. When activated, the cypher pushes all adjacent creatures fifteen metres away from the point of activation.
- Cypher of the Iron King:  A jagged iron spike, *smeared with blood*. When impaled into the flesh of another creature, that creature becomes your thrall, as per the spell dominate person.
- A moonstone fragment *warped by magic*. When thrown at a target, the cypher explodes into a cloud of noxious gas (3d6 poison damage and poisoned, Con save half and negates).

## Lesser
- A slender spindle of topaz containing a *mote of darkness*. When impaled into flesh, the cypher dissolves and causes localised acid burns, dealing 1d6 damage over 1d4 rounds. 
- A jagged shard of sapphire smeared with *black ichor*. When held and activated, ~~the cypher conjures a stone tower.~~
-  A platinum shard on a leather cord. When thrown at a target, the cypher destroys metal objects.

- A jagged shard of gray crystal smeared with crimson blood. When thrown, the cypher animates the struck object for 15 minutes.
- A broken iron rod damaged by flame. When thrown at a target, the cypher explodes into a cloud of concealing smoke (disadvantages against any rolls by 3d4 per throw, lasts 2d6 rounds).
- A malachite shard etched by acid. When thrown at a target, the cypher polymorphs it into a mouse, con save negates.
- A Bamboo pipe, buzzing with wasps. When thrown, it bursts into a swarm of wasps. 
- A broken moonstone idol engraved with geometric patterns. When thrown at a target, the cypher conjures an area of invisibility.
