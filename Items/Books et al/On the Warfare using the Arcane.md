This tome is written in luminous ink engraved into blackened glass plates, bound in black dragon scales. It is locked by a intangible mechanism, which seems to loosen partially depending on location. 
%%It only opens within the Archive of Old.%% 

Once unlocked, one may spend up to 8 hours per day studying it, which will each grant knowledge about taking magic onto the battlefield, such as a recipe, spell, or ritual. 
The tome holds knowledge for 34 greater cyphers, 56 lesser cyphers and 27 potions. 
%%Per hour of study, a D100 is rolled, and knowledge will be granted as follows:%%
