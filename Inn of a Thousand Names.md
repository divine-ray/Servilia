An elegant dwarven inn, which is said to have a thousand doors in a thousand towns, each under a different sign and name. Anyone who enters through a particular door can only leave through that same door, unless they know the [[innkeeper]]'s secret.
Each house shares some similarities with the other houses, but not enough to differ from the local architecture and culture. Almost like secret codices allow for easy spotting of these inns and taverns. 



One door remains particularly interesting; framed with polished white marble, of a strangely black wood, embossed with greenish-yellow metal. The wood seems like charcoal, yet is tough as a freshly felled tree.
[[Just open the door.]]
But it won't let itself be opened, it resists.
Patrons of the inn gossip about voices beyond the door, strange noises, but those remain rumours. They drank too much. Yes, they had too much beer.
But I want to investigate what's behind the door, it's causing me restless nights,
and the few times I sleep
I dream the same dream, of opening it with ease, but waking up just before the mechanism swings open. 
Let me open the door. 
I need to know what is behind this door. 
This is killing me, **let me open the door.**
