The true belief of the [[Followers of Mekhane|Mekhanites]] advocates sapience, education and technology through constructs and arcane engineering. They view any life as tool or actor in a grand plan, which eventually shall bring forth [[Mekhane]]s Will and create the perfect machine. 
[[Nølkā]] aspire to become beasts, and consume all that is. Any living being that is not part of them is merely sought after as lowly food, and all [[Beyond]] considered the [ultimate challenge](Theophagy.md). 
Nolka are seen as primitive, yet highly capable hunter-gatherers, only modifying their ways if they are strictly pressed to do so. 

For a certain while, they managed to coexist without major conflicts, lest minor clashing occured on a day-to-day basis. Eventually, pressure and conflict rose and gave way to the devastating, era-defining [[Nølkā-Mekhanite War]].
