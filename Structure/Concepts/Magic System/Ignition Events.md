*(name pending, subject to change)*

As [[Amarisk]] [accumulates and amasses itself](Amarisk%20Emission) (due not being consumed or decaying), it builds up until the mass collapses into itself.

These collapse events are called ignitions, and a advanced species' Amarisk sphere usually undergoes at least two ignitions.
It\'s a event akin to a vacuum implosion, which causes a rapid expansion afterwards.

Commonly described as a noosphere by newbies to the subject, but it has proven to be a shallow water running deep. 
## First Ignition
After a significant buildup of [[Amarisk]], it will, as mentioned, collapse unto itself, creating a parallel dimension localised to it's planet and species.
If several sentient species are widespread on this planet, then the parallel dimension will take on a blend of properties of these species. 
The [[Pulastaya]][^1] of this planet acts as parental figure to this dimension and therefore said dimension will shape itself to their Pula. 
In this state, the parallel dimension bears nothing but a feverishly dreamt materialisation of said impacting factors. 
## Second Ignition 
A second ignition is soon to follow after the first; given that populace remained steadily growing, passively radiating [[Amarisk]] into the layer. 
However, this time around, the fold can be percieved by sensitive individuals and regulars alike, for it marks the birth of Sapience of This Layer.
Hereafter, the Layer has been described as [[Twilit]], as it resembles the "true" world yet degrading notable influences like artificial reshaping through terrain or buildings. In addition, most species capable of shifting their perception into There have reported it to be devoid of colours. 

The newborn Twilit is on the mental development of a toddler, and will act as such towards stimuli, regardless of their origin. 

This event seeds a rare genetic strain or trait among their species (assuming they are carbon and DNA based), that will enable these individuals to shift themselves, most times only partially, into this [[Twilit]]. 
 
## Further Ignitions
Any further events are not known to cause more major events (in the human twilight).

They add more depth to the twilight, to store the excess Amarisk generated.
