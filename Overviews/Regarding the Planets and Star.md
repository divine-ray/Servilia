%%I puzzled this together at 1am, forgive me%%
Most of the present solar system is polished to the degree where I need it to be, with the planet and it's three moons having received the most attention.

Any other planet has only been named and described through what is visible using simpler optics (existing technology) in their respective cultures.
For the full catalogue please read [[The Utuw Family]], as the solar system heavily plays into the theme of a family (one parent figure, the star Utuw and their children/descendants, the planets, and their siblings/children, the moons). 
Schi, the main earthlike planet itself, is only described on one continent since the residents of this continent named Servilia can't trespass the [[Edge of Hope]].
	In summary, there's a [[Edge Kraken|phenomenon]] that forbids naval and aerial travellers to trespass a invisible border.
It is simply too much work for me to create and maintain more than one continent, all with trying-to-be unique cultures and whatnot.
Therefore, only one continent shall exist, but if you so have thematically fitting ideas, please let me know.
