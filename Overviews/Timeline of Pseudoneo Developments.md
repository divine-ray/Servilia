The [[The Lavish Empire|Lavish Empire]] created a notable amount of species during its existence, some of which persist and continue to exist past the extinction of their creators. 

Among the earliest of these creatures were the [[Sleeker|Sleekers]], which were the first opportunity to interact with humanity. These date to roughly -1500 BFE. 

[[Songbird|Songbirds]] have been created in their first endeavour of a sentient airborne species with subtle intent to challenge the [[Dragonkin]]. The majority of Songbird flocks has been eradicated in a containment sweep, as they realised that an ungoverned, self-reproducing pseudoneo poses a serious threat. 
A modified form of Sleekers dubbed [[Dabs]] by humans aided in the construction of the massive [[SC-AM]] project, which persist into the second era to maintain it. 

Originally a realm of spirits and energies, the highlands now known as [[Hollow Mountains]] have been gifted protectors and sentinels in the form of [[Warped Angel|Warped Angels]]. Following the forced migration of the remaining [[Nølkā]], these angels became foul copies of their former selves and turned against everything in their territory.  
After the [[Raising]] following the construction of the Fountainhead aided by the SC-AM, the Lavish realised along with Mankind that these mountains are extremely dense in ore by intent. To exploit these deposits, [[Dwarves]] were assembled. Featuring insectoid anatomy and prototypes of biocompatible metallurgy, these beings are among the sturdiest of all Servilia. Having learnt from the mistakes of Songbirds, they are not entirely sentient as individuals, but organised as a network of hives or colonies. 

The Lavish endeavours both peaked and collapsed in the [[ti-mud'ĝál Ĝiš-hur|Create Life Plan]]: The collaboration of [[Dragonkin]], Lavish and [[Mankind]] to recreate the corporeal divinity once present in [[Ohrthyrst]]. [[Làma'el-iri]] was the first and only settlement of this perfected life form, which eventually was met with harsh opposition and military force from the betrayed [[Empire of Thylyist|Thylyist]]. This led to the [[Fall]] of Làma’el.
