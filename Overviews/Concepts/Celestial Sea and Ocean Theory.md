New concept regarding the [[Planes.canvas|Planes]], [[Eternal Sea]] and so on;
spacetime or w/e is an ocean, with the uppermost surface representing the ‘material plane’, aka where most of the conventional universe resides.
subsurface lies the [[Twilit]]s layers and transient between is [[Between]].
Deeper down lays the [[dark domain]], and at the seeming bottom of this bottomless pit is [[The Void]].

logically in conclusion, it is possible to move between these layers by being sufficiently distant from a physical object (I.e a planet) using a sufficiently sophisticated vessel (spaceship, [[Spelljammers]]). alternatively, a “well bore” could be excavated and pierce straight through matter and ’water’ to change ‘altitude’. 

[[Soul Theory]] - [[A Realm Beyond]] may be the depths of the eternal sea, souls rising to the surface and falling back down as they die
