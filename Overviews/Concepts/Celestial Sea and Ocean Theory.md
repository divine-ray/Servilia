New concept regarding the [[Planes.canvas|Planes]], [[Eternal Sea]] and so on;
spacetime or w/e is an ocean, with the uppermost surface representing the ‘material plane’, aka where most of the conventional universe resides.
subsurface lies the [[Twilit]]s ”layers” and transient between is [[Between]].
Deeper down lays the [[dark domain]], and at the seeming bottom of this bottomless pit is [[The Void]].

logically in conclusion, it is possible to move between these layers by being sufficiently distant from a physical object (I.e a planet) using a sufficiently sophisticated vessel (spaceship, [[Spelljammers]]). alternatively, a “well bore” could be excavated and pierce straight through matter and ’water’ to change ‘altitude’.  ^3172ac

[[Soul Theory]] - [[A Realm Beyond]] may be the depths of the eternal sea, souls rising to the surface and falling/sinking back down as they die.

The twilit is directly integrated into the celestial sera, with depth varying depending on the local amarisk strength - but never zero, as Amarisk scatters far out enough to create a very thin layer of twilit.

The depth of twilit is analogous to common oceans, but where the light spectrum in water oceans decays, concepts, matter and space-time itself decays and dilates. 

I would (11.08.25~13-07) say that the twilit is a local addition or depth layer to the celestial sea/ocean and only present where sentient life emits amarisk for ignitions
