During the night in areas of lesser stability or threadbare weave, people may loose some control over their bodies:

Dreamtalkers, chatting and talking when sleeping in a fully articulate manner
they appear to be part of conversations, though as awake, but clearly asleep, talking to someone or something who clearly is not present.

Sleepwalkers, yet in behaviour like ordinary day to day activities. but at night.
They get up, get dressed and pursue their ordinary day to day lives, but in the midst of the night and deep asleep, unresponsive to any stimuli or touch.

and moonwalkers, humanoid apparitions that appear and vanish based on the phase of one moon, with behaviour varying based on the other moon(s)
