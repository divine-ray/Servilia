Strands of energies, stretching across space and time.
Like strings pinned down, they tangle up and straighten again.
One of the many shapes of [[Amarisk]]- yet not woven of [[Twilit]]. 
Unique in their own ways, these threads connect places and planets alike, covering great distances.
Soaring heights and hills cause ties and tangle, plains soothe the weave. 
Invisible to the common eye like many of amarisk, ethereally tangible yet never in grasp. 
Those attuned could reach out and hold the awry colours and threads, but for what?
