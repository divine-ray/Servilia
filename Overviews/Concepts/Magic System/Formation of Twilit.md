Re: [[Ignition Events]]
Through the accumulation of amarisk, the [[Twilit]] collapsed unto itself, having created several copies of the planet’s memories in the process. The depth of the layer and the loss of detail are related to the depth and amount of the memories and experiences made of the species, and thus tied to the population density. 
In other terms; As the total population of sentient beings grows, their recent layers of twilit gain in detail and accuracy (to the “real” world).
