Some gods which fell victim to theophagy were too big/posionous/... to fully consume, and have been thrown into the sea, which saw a similar phenomenon to whale falls IRL.
Their residual divinity, however, empowered several aquatic species which fed on their corpses, which gave way to some of the more unusual aquatic life.  
As corses are manifested off pure amarisk, these events removed a lot of potential energy from the cycles, which contributed to the lessening of ambient magic.
