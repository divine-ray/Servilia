Strands of energies, stretching across space and time.
Like strings pinned down, they tangle up and straighten again.
One of the many shapes of [[Amarisk]]- yet not woven of [[Twilit]]. 
Unique in their own ways, these threads connect places and planets. 
Soaring heights and hills cause ties and tangle, plains soothe the weave.
