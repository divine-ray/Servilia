A small area in which the [[weave]] is threadbare and not entirely solid. 
This commonly leads to other [[Planes.canvas|Planes]] breaching, causing odd and unusual events. 
With the weave and veil being permeable to things [[Between]] and [[Beyond]], these areas are considered very risky to traverse and avoided at all costs by travellers. 
Certainâ€¦ *sightings* left the few brave explorers unsettled, some driven to insanity.

However, this easily accessed breach is highly valued by [[magic people]], as it drastically reduces their effort required to interact with the weave. 

The strength of the weave varies over time, and threadbare areas tend to move or close. 

With the fluctuations and shifts seen in these veils it is unavoidable for the [[Railroad and Trains of Servilia Assoc.]] to occasionally pass through these, which prompted them to enact the [[Association Protocol on Anomalous Incidents]].
