rite of [[Ascension]] - placing an effigy made from [[Corse]] flesh and a conduit (spiritual/conceptual link) into their body, usually in the chest cavity
this effigy absorbs the corse flesh, merges with the conduit and starts to devour the intellect of the ascendant, to become the ascendant and leave their body as [[Hollowed]] shell. 
The effigy matures until it has become the ascendant and animated. At that point, the human is considered dead. 
In the ceremony, the cavity is reopened with the newborn ascendant freed.
