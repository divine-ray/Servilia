Each soul is only a visitor from [[A Realm Beyond]], only tied into the mortal shell.
Souls without any coherence and such enter a state of degenerate matter, known as [[Amarisk]] or [[Spirits]]. Exposure to too much entropy and chaos can deteriorate souls, deform them until they cannot reside in a physical body anymore, but need special procedures ([[Birth of Energy]]) to be materialised.  ^57693b

This opens the questions of "Where are souls formed?" and "Where does Amarisk gain coherence to become a soul?" and "Is it possible to reverse the deformation of a soul?"
And the question of "Where does the soul go after the death of it's shell?" is answered by the entire dilemma of the Undead and Charon being broken.[^2]

That being the soul being unable to depart from the mortal vessel, thus being forced to reside in the decaying body which is leeching this soul's power. 
The soul is facing progressing decay as its very energy is suspending the body, eventually leading to madness and frenzy if not ailed. Individuals in the terminal stages are referred to as [[Hollowed]] or Husks, since they're nothing but a shell of their former self.

In case of extreme damage to the body under certain violent circumstances, the soul may escape the shell and eventually turn into a ghastly shape, much akin to [[Spirits]], filled with everlasting thirst of vengeance.[^1] 
Spirits and other ghastly entities only manifest from murder or if the body is unjustly violated or the soul is not granted a graceful opportunity to disassociate from their shell.




[^1]: Severe physical trauma, which renders it incapable of holding the soul anymore after death ([[Curse of the Undead]]).
[^2]: ~~Possibly~~ The [[Afterlives]] are also dysfunctional, same as the rivers [[Acheron]] and [[Styx]], due to the collapse caused by the Nolka.
