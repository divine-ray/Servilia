  - Death of Divinity

In their gluttony for power, on the off-road to [[Apotheosis]], the [[Nølkā]] devoured all that is divine, including [[Schi ut-Pula]]/[[Possible reasons why Schi-Ut-Pula vanished]]. 
The massive power vacuum on the spaces [[Beyond]] allowed [[New Gods]] to rise to power, all bearing the imprint of a terrified and directionless mankind, instilled with fear. Some, if not most, even slotted themselves into the places and domains formerly ruled by the old gods, now reduced to [Corses](Corse.md). 

On the flip side, the complete lack of direction allows [some people](Frisco%20Bay%20Confederation) to develop freely, stripping the shackles of the past and pushing onwards. 

After the [[Nølkā]] feasted on all [flesh poppets](Corse.md) of the deities present, they considered themselves unstoppable, unaware of [[How Dying ceased|the]] [[Curse of the Undead|consequences]] nor the ever-lasting presence of the [[Old Gods]], who remain observant, yet lacking of their physical actors. Left to observe, but amused at the foolishness of humanity attempting to seize their powers. This has happened before, and will happen again.
