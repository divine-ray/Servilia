A Corse are the remains, corpse, of a deity after [[Theophagy|its poppet has been consumed.]]
Corses are visually related to [[Liches]], as they share a skeletal appearance and nigh-infinite powers.
With it's Divine Link Severed, this poppet keeps a faint memory of what it used to be, prone to mental decay and confusion. 
Some seek reunion and restoration of the Divine Link, some seek rest and solace, some revenge on their murderers, devourers. 

The divine manifestation of faith incarnate, stripped of it's soul and power, turned mortal and cursed to remain stuck on this world, with no reunification in sight.
