## Towns and Cities
- Greenhome: A two-storey stone-walled building which has been completely overgrown by flowering vines, with scale-like leaves and thorny, writhing branches. It is the home of Nina, a young green dragon sage. The Earth Shrine: A wondrous monolith of precious stone, said to hold the ruby heart of a world. On every full moon, dew hued in the colour of that moon condenses on it. Local folks say it is crying. 
- The ruins of a seven-sided tower, which appears restored upon the night of the new moon.
- The [[Gallows Tree]]: A long-dead ironwood tree, said to be haunted by the ghosts of the thieves and murderers which once hung from it.
	THIS FOR THE TWO HANGMEN
- [[Inn of a Thousand Names]]
-  The Pool of Radiance: A small pool of water, which glows with a flickering blue light. It is said to be haunted by a malevolent spirit, waiting for a worthy creature to possess. The local townsfolk avoid it.
- The Temple of Ariel, God of Plants: An impressive terraced building, decorated with carved friezes and golden inscriptions.
- The Shrine of Ilgad: A cauldron lamp enshrining the flame of Ilgad, God of the Sky, said to reveal visions to those who leave an offering.
- The Water Shrine: A wondrous arch of clear water, said to reveal visions to those who drink from it.
- James' Armaments: A neglected weaponsmith workshop, built around a shrine of Manael, Goddess of War.
- The Broken Spear II: A shabby elven tavern, entirely managed by cats. Its name comes from being a perfect duplicate of The Broken Spear, another inn on the other side of town, from the building itself to its d√©cor and even patrons.
 - The Stormspire: An obelisk of rune-carved stone, engraved with columns of arcane glyphs. Each time the spire is struck by lightning, it vanishes for exactly nine hours. Each time it returns, some of the glyphs have changed.
 - [[The House of Deseldo]]: A large half-timbered theatre, which has one door here and another in [[Ohrthyrst]].
	 - [[The Broken Orchestra]]
 - The Dragon Stables: The original stalls of this huge stone-walled building were each large enough to hold a young dragon. They have been divided by wooden frames into horse stalls, which are hired out to merchants, pilgrims, and other travellers.
 - The Stone Dragon: A colossal petrified dragon stands over the street. It is said that the dragon will be made flesh again if any descendant of the wizard who imprisoned it passes by without leaving a coin.
 - The Sawmill: A derelict building of brick and slate, filled with complex dwarven machines. It is apparent that the building is a sawmill, but no-one has been able to work out how to operate it in many generations.
 - The Marut: An ancient cyclopean colossus of unweathered stone, where local merchants come to make contracts. It is said that anyone who breaks an oath sworn upon the Marut will be slain before the next dawn.
# Items
## Rods
Surveyor's Rod (Rod): 
	While holding this rod, you know the distance to any fixed landscape feature you can see, such as a tree, mountain, oasis, castle, island, etc.
## Wondrous Items
- Bucket of Armor (Wondrous Item): 
	This simple wooden bucket is filled with scraps of leather and metal, and weighs 20 pounds. While you carry it in one hand, your base AC becomes 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
- Bag of Candle Holding (Wondrous Item):
    This bag can hold up to 100 kg (250 pcs.) of
    candles, but weighs 15 pounds regardless
    of its contents.  Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.
- - Mummer's Potion (Wondrous Item):
    While wearing these white gloves, you can use an action to conjure tiny, invisible barriers of magical force, of the sort used by mummers for their theatre.  The effect lasts for as long as you concentrate on it, up to 10 minutes.  You can also use a reaction  to conjure a larger barrier to protect you, which gives you a +5 bonus to AC.  This ends the effect at the start of your next turn. The gloves can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
## Scrolls
Origami Messenger (Scroll):
    You can use an action to read this scroll, which causes it to fold itself into a tiny origami squid. The object will fly to a destination and deliver a message, as though you had cast the spell Animal Messenger (phb 212).


## Rings and Baubles
- Symbiotic Ring (Ring, requires attunement):
    When you put this carved bone ring on, it becomes snug around your
    finger and turns the colour of your blood.  While you are attuned to
    the ring, you gain 10 temporary hit points daily at dawn.

## Armour
Scale Mail of the Serpent (Armor, scale mail, requires attunement):
    While wearing this scale mail, you can use an action to speak its
    command word.  The armour transforms into a giant constrictor snake, with you still inside it. The creature acts on its own initiative count and follows your mental commands.
    The armour returns to its normal form when you use an action to speak the command word again, or if the creature is reduced to 0 hit points.  The armour can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
