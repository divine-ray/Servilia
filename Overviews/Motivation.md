The main motivation and incentive behind this project and piece of work is of multiple layers:
- It serves me to organise and unify several different genres and influences[^1]. 
- It is a great pastime and helps catalysing ADHD. 
- It doubles as memory management, as several aspects are influenced by experiences. 
- It acts as mental canvas. 
- The original motivation, with its relics still visible, was to create an extensive playfield for a TTRPG in the vein of D&D 5e.
