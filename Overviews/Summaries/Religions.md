A comprehensive summary of Cults, Organised Religions and other followings present in Servilia. 
Loosely sorted by impact and known member count. 

## [[Followers of Mekhane]]
One of the two big religions ever formed in Servilia, this religion descended from the remnants of their once-great Mekhanite religion. 
Originally created as direct worshippers of [[Mekhane]]s will at the conception of Mankind, now turned into a lesser, deviated hodgepodge, in which their highest ranks assume the positions of dictatorship. 
After the [[Nølkā-Mekhanite War]], they broke down, scrambled at the destruction of their god, Mekhane. Having received the order to restore and [[His Divine Reassembly|to put him back together]], they set out in massive reconissance operations to retrieve parts at all costs, but eventually gave up, eventually curling up into the [[Empire of Thylyist]], a locked-down isolationist state where free speech and thought is rare. 
As they seized the government through religious soliders and warriors, the empire of Thylyist entered a catatonic state of regression and standstill.   
### [[True Machinists]]
Disagreement in regards to teaching and execution of the holy scriptures within the Mekhanites has led rise to a new movement, who believe that the interpretation of the Mekhanites is against the design of the [[Blessed Machine]].
Additionally, the adherents of the Machinists believe that the human flesh is inferior to the Machine, and thus seek to replace it through metal. 

## [[Nølkā]]
The other big religion, directly [[Prime Clash of Nolka vs Mekhanites|opposing]] the Mekhanites. Mostly untied from a deity, but rather oriented around becoming their own gods through [[Apotheosis]]. Their only notable figure is their lost prophet, who attempted to topple and kill [[Yaldabaoth]], the Chaos-Mother of Mankind. 
Survived the War barely, now is scattered across the continent in loose village groups and within the [[Ancient Exile]].
