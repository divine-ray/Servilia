## [[Empire of Thylyist|Empire of Thylyist]]
Former city-state, grown to the size of a empire. 
The City of Thylyist is their capital, and epicentre of their official religion, the [[Followers of Mekhane]], originally conceived as bunker-fort installation shortly before the end of the [[Nølkā-Mekhanite War]].
Their government is practically defunct. Instead, the religious elite ([[Council of Thylyist]]), and to a extend, the [[Gearforged Vanguard]] is de-facto ruling. The fanatical devotion impacts everyday life and has frozen technological and scientific progress, leaving them stuck in early steam-driven technology. However, this has been highly refined, leading to complex automatons and other steampunk machinery. 
Throughout time, this fanaticism led them towards a senseless, rabid aggression towards anything considered magic by their elite, by which they brainwashed all citizens asides from select circles to believe that *their* technology is the only true there is. 
Vast parts of their cities are being driven by fragments of their God, [[Mekhane]]. 
## [[Frisco Bay Confederation]]
Conglomerate of various cities, situated in the [[Frisco Bay]].
Originally founded by outcasts of Thylyist, who have been expelled due to ”heresy”[^economy].
They freed themselves off the religious constraints, and are thus advancing at steady pace. 
Current marvels of their craft involve [[Electricity]], the [[Development of Petrochemistry]] and [[Development of Printing]], all of which are conducted and researched on in [[Duley and Port]].
Their scholars and researchers are roughly aware of magic and lesser details of it, but unable to harness and utilise it themselves, and not paid much attention to due to their yielding developments in technology. 
Effectively the strongest, both economically and military, force, notably due to their intense naval operations at [[Brisburne]], and the extensive [[Servilian Railroad and Train Network]]. 

[^economy]:  Beliefs in more liberal economy, unrestrained science and technology, rights of the people in democracy. 
## [[Davern Kingdom]]
A Kingdom residing to the rightmost upper quarter of the continent, being stuck in technological development due to their plethora of arcane assets and active use of magical arts.
However, this is poorly understood, so the act of creating magical artefacts and weaving spells is unknown to them. Most of their assets are sourced from old ruins and scavenging, typically bought from smugglers. 
[[The Old King]] recently deceased and entered a deified state through folklore, but his corpse remains; sapient and aware, yet in eternal torment. 
They harbour a notable [[Nølkā]] community, which has quite a impact on the local culture. 
## [[Nølkā]]/[[Ancients]]
The remains of a once-great religion concentrated into a artificial mountain valley mound, following the aftermath of the [[Nølkā-Mekhanite War]]. Originally a continent-spanning religious empire which worshipped the creation of flesh through devouring it and shaping it anew.
They aspired to devour gods and obtain their power through [[Apotheosis]] and [[Theophagy]]. 
Their greed and gluttony to ascend further caused much of the common nowadays bad state of affairs, such as the [[Curse of the Undead]].
Through time and isolation, the isolated populace lost the belief in the Nølkān Ways, effectively giving birth to the cultural mash of the Ancients. 

## [[Sepulchre]]
A community of [[Sepulchre|Undying]] folks, forcefully herded together as they have been rejected from any other nation so far. Seen as scum and scoundrel, the undead are suffering a unjust terrible reputation, despite a fair share of them contributing major work towards the Confederation's economy. 
Built in the labyrinthine underground of the ruins of [[Lost City of the Ninth Forest|Tombstone]], which originally only served as storage and logistics for the fallen city. Nowadays, Sepulchre is under the looming threat of Lichs, as these catacombs guard vaults of lichen vessels and other banished relics.
