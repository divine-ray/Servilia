#Overview 
Welcome, foreigner.  
Oh, what drives you around, into my humble domicile?
Nevertheless, thou appear to seek answers to thy questions; who I shall provide.
But to which crevice of the continent is your interest?
# Division
The Continent Servilia has been divided in five to six major regions, with two lesser. 
The major regions include:
- [[Long Savannah]]
	A large, flat stretch of land, which undergone a large climate shift after a [natural fission reactor](Searing%20Lode) has surfaced and directed its thermal output upon the plains. 
- [[Sea Major]]
	The majority of the oceans and water. Not much is known about any notable properties, as exploration has ceased shortly after establishing secure routes. 
	- [[Astral Ocean]]
- [[Ninth Forest]]
	Lush and verdant yet dangerous forest, spanning a majority of the upper right landmass. 
- [[Northern Reaches]]
	A displaced polar climate, long ago only another landmass. Held in a tight stranglehold by [[The Cold]], which is the cause for the unusual climate. 
- [[Hollow Mountains]]
	Bare rocks [rose](Rising) from the ground to entrap an despised bunch, now prone to collapsing due to excessive mining and excavation from peculiar beings known as [[Dwarves]]. 

The Lesser Regions, declared Areas, are:
(Those mostly regard the few urbanised Areas.)
- [[Amida]] (only present in *The Future*)
- [[Empire of Thylyist]]
- [[Frisco Bay Confederation]]
- [[Davern Kingdom]]
- [[Sepulchre]]


- Highlands/Plateau to the lower right, off Frisco Bay
- [[Palga Basin]]
