#Overviews 
Welcome, foreigner.  
Oh, what drives you around, into my humble domicile?
Nevertheless, thou appear to seek answers to thy questions; who I shall provide.
But to which crevice of the continent is your interest?

# Division
The Continent Servilia is divided in five to six major regions, with two lesser. 
The Major regions include.

- [[Sea Major]]
 The majority of the oceans and water. 
	- [[Astral Ocean]]
 
- [[Ninth Forest]]
- [[Northern Reaches]]
The Lesser Regions, nomenclated as Areas, are:

- [[Amida]] (only present in The Future)
- [[Empire of Thylyist]]
- [[Frisco Bay]]
