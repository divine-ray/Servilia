#Structure #Overview 
This page aims to describe current issues that are inflicting trouble on the various factions and religions. 
# [[Empire of Thylyist]]
## Population
Ongoing poverty, failing harvests, plummeting quality and standards of life. Absence of maintenance towards public interests such as trade routes, water infrastructure and security (i.e. protection from theft, burglary and assassinations) is giving raise to [[Organised Crime]].  
Additionally, the misery of citizens is feeding the New God of [[Fear and Hunger]]. 
Generally, the stagnation and recession of technology and overbearing control forced quite many citizens into small, covert groups in which the law is broken. These groups, however, not interacting nor aware of another, thus cannot network to create organised protests and such. 
## [[Council of Thylyist]]
Those parts of the council that aren’t completely proxy figures to the Mekhanites are becoming increasingly corrupt and influenced by various wealthy organisations and merchants guilds.
## [[Followers of Mekhane|Mekhanites]]
Escalating fanaticism into a spiral of delusional worship, which makes them blind towards the consequences of their actions-> [[Stressors on Factions#Population]]. 
More-so the isolationism and deviation from their quest of [[His Divine Reassembly]] is raising insecurities among the broader masses of their adherents, as this is their supposed ideal goal and strife, now becoming increasingly volatile. 
### [[True Machinists|New religious movement]]
Additionally, a splinter group of the Mekhanites is starting to gain power and attention, which preaches for shedding their humanity and turning to the blessed machine.
Completely contrasting to the existing set of beliefs, this movement preaches open trade and free thought and action of the individual, which is causing great tension. Nor can the existing preachers easily eliminate these, since their influence is already too great to risk assassination. 

# [[Sepulchre]]/Kukku
Sitting atop lichen reliquary catacombs bears great risk to all involved. 
The continuing, and growing rate of undying arriving in their spaces is bound to cause housing and space issues sometime.
Rising instability from digging out more rooms without adequate support bears the risk of cave-ins. 
The deconstruction of former Tombstone buildings might also be lashing out to the subterranean areas.
