storyline: "[[Return of Automatia]]"
---
We have spotted what appears to be our long-lost engineering marvel, the renown ship [[Automatia]]. 
She has been sent out on her first voyage to test the very early systems of electricity, and to stress-test those novel techniques our engineers have created. 
Contact to it has been lost since the 13th Apsni 1424, and we never had reports of sightings before. But now, today, on the 19th Nika 1426, it has been seen to the coast of the [[Davern Kingdom]]. Her land engineering crew are most delighted to hear the news, but I am concerned of why it has been lost so long. 
We will continue to observe the situation. 

Addendum, 14th Banara 1426: 
We have been granted the authorisation and legitimation to send out a small vessel to look into the situation where she currently seems to have anchored. Any attempts of communication, may it be morse, clack or shouting, have been left unanswered. 

Vessel report, 20th Banara 1426
Our crew boarded the Automatia with great ease. It quickly struck us that no man was aboard, and only the mechanisms assisting the man-driven navigation brought her here. There was not a soul to be found, nor any cargo. The entire ship was completely emptied, set aside a few barnacles and those things nailed and riveted shut. 
The sails are also intact, and rolled up neatly, as the machinery did, therefore it must not have suffered a typhoon or other horrible wind. 
We are left clueless, and terrified where the crew has gone.
