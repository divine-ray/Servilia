### Authority and Reign %%This is the Present.%%
Ended [[The First Era]] through the nuclear extinction of the (known) Lavish, and the partial destruction of the Fountainhead. 
During this era, the Thylyian Military seizes control over the government and establishes martial law %%for centuries to come%%. Secretly driven by the knowledge that their God, [[Mekhane]], has been shattered, the [[Followers of Mekhane|Mekhanite]] zealots took control over Thylyist in the name of Mekhane and His Divine Reassembly. 
Justifying their actions using the looming threat of the Void seeping from the Fountainhead, they had eradicated all mentions of arcane working within the Thylyian society. 
Magic and all knowledge about it a whole was banished into the [[Archive of Old]] and became a mere tell-tale to the general population. 
However, the automatons and pseudoneo-mechanised crossovers of the First Era are still present and active, but are kept as state secret. 
The military reign keeps driving innovation, with the sole intention to kill the most efficiently, whereas the Citadel of the Gear and it's followers create complex automatons, driven by clockwork and steam.  
Under the martial law, Thylyist isolated itself into the now-known walled off fortress city-state-empire. 

Undying people are considered unnatural (within Thylyist), and suffer from extreme discrimination and forced relocation into [[Sepulchre]].

%%Future: Eventually, the Military gets couped by the Daeva revolutionists, backed by the Frisco Bay confederation.%%

During this time, the outcast of Thylyist bunch up and settle in the [[Frisco Bay]], effectively founding the [[Frisco Bay Confederation|Bay Confederation]]. Freed from the religious-military dogma and propaganda of Thylyist, they rapidly outperform and rush past Thylyist in terms of development and economic strength.  
A few of their major advancements include a peace treaty with any civilisation but Thylyist, the [[Servilian Railroad and Train Network]], the [[Development of Printing]] and eventually, electricity.
