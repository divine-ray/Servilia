Oh, the human has opened the [door](Tunnels.md)
The human has seen us. Seen our remains. 
We take the chance, show who we are.
Rats, we are the Rats, Rats! 
Take their food that they keep from us. Break into their homes. 
Rats, Rats, We are the Rats!
Show them our paint. Show them we're better. Our help from the others. 
We are. Rats! are we Rats! Rats. 
Yes, our murals! OUR paintings!! They WILL see OUR GREATNESS, OUR VAST NUMBERS!
Long enough they trapped our kind, fed us poison, suppressed us!!
WE SHALL SURFACE; TAKE THEIR HOMES; TAKE THEIR FOOD!!
