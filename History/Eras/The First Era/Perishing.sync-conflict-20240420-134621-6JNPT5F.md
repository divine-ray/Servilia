Does [[God]] live in heaven in fear of what he has created?
In the First Day, this was, indeed, the case: The Creator fleeting, in loss of control and regulation of his making. 
On the Second Day, He was faced with a utmost devastating choice; As to retreat, dwindle and eventually die, or to seize force and violently recover His Rule. 
The Third Day, He had been left behind. For his Angels, Apostates and Devotees have turned away from His Guiding Light. 
At the brink of the Fourth Day, His followers, whole, instead, reached out to their freedom, and vacated. The Halls of Heaven have been forsaken, the spark of life and love gone. 
During the Fifth Day, He was struck with nostalgia, attempting to reignite the passion that filled him aeons ago. 
It was on the Sixth Day that he, unwillingly, let Time choose. God accepted his Demise, His Fate to slowly perish. 
The Seventh day, He attempted to reconcile His Followers. A feeble attempt, for They have left His reach forevermore. 
The Eighth Day, He struck the World Below with Wonders and Terrors alike, blessing one, smiting another, without care. His few, dwindling worshippers, struck with panic, pleading for mercy.  
On the Ninth Day, God yielded. He caved in. Seeing His Word falter and die. 

The Tenth Day marks the the End of God.
