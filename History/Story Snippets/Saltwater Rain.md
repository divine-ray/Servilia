Open my Eyes, see upon the saltwater rain.
Take on the [[Empty Crown]], settle upon the Throne of Nothing.
A King for a Kingdom, A Nobody for Nothing.
Hearts like ours; missing pieces. 
Wars inside heads, fighting for dominion over something nobody shall ever acknowledge, nor perceive. 
Lest, they drown in regret, falling apart together.
No mend in sight, cannot contract, cannot heal. 
The wish to be full, to be whole, yet, there's only nothing to be seen, to be done.

It is the gods that weep, [[The Weather Deity]] shedding their sorrows upon the land
Their tears burn the flesh and open old scars,
Flood the minds with sorrow and regret, 
Those feeble souls collapse 
and become nothing but a source for a river of tears
