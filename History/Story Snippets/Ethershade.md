This, this concoction. 
I always wanted to see. Yes, see. 
But see without moving, without travelling the lands.
And what good is all travel once you've been around the planet? 
I wanted to see further, Into the eternal sea, gaze upon the little fishes of light toying across their infinite playground. Talk to the planets, chatter to specks of light we never knew. 
Maybe talk to my mother, may she hold a happy life, wherever she may be now.

This mortal coil; it disgusts me. 
	It lacks the colours i want to see.
	It is awfully plain.
	Let me free, let me break my mind free from my bony cage, this damned prison you call a temple, something blessed. 
	For it is fiendish, its curse holding you back, tying you down.
Don't you see? 
	It holds you back, entraps you.
	Makes you think.
	Makes you believe.
	Turns you into a figure, Another cheap figure, a number on papers.
	This body is but a prison to hold us back, to restrain our powers.
	We can be much more.
	Can do more.

All it takes... Is this.
_The figure hands you a small leathery bag._

The tapestry of our universe, of our world, glued and stuck together by someone who clearly does not know their craft.
Here's a crack, there's a unfinished seam.
It's all so obvious, all in grasp.
	A common man could become something you call a god, yet we all collectively decide to don‘t. As if it‘s some “Great Evil” to use our potential, the power running through us.
Time is yarn, and we yearn to unravel the threads.
We have seen what you will never see, spoken to what you will never hear, and listened to truths that are more correct than any lie you may ever speak.
