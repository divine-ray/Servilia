*The* early findings of [[Electricity]] have been incredibly promising, and it seems that sufficiently powerful sources can be connected to a long cable, typically strung up a building or on a airship, will create a ineffable signal, which could possibly be caught and received by a similar device. 
This technology seems invaluable going forward, as it'd drastically ease our organisation of aerial traffic over at [[Duley and Port]], and possibly replace a fair bit of mail and courier traffic.
