"It had to happen sometime"

crude oil deposits are mostly found around the long savannah and somewhere in the proximity of the atoll islands in the astral ocean, the latter to remain untouched for ages since the realisation of offshore oil deposits being far away.
the expensive extraction of oil has left coal/wood (gasification) favoured for fuelling purposes, with the entire chemistry processing of polymers yet to be found. 
coal/wood gas is still used plentifully for lighting purposes using gas mantles, and among the fees magic communities, aided by contracted fire spirits. 
### Antiquity

The book of [II Maccabees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II_Maccabees "II Maccabees") (2nd cent. BC) tells how a "thick water" was put on a sacrifice at the time of [Nehemiah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehemiah "Nehemiah") and when the sun shone it caught fire. It adds that "those around Nehemiah termed this 'Nephthar', which means Purification, but it is called Nephthaei by the many."[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naphtha#cite_note-6) This same substance is mentioned in the [Mishnah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnah "Mishnah") as one of the generally permitted oils for lamps on [Shabbat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat "Shabbat"), although [Rabbi Tarfon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi_Tarfon "Rabbi Tarfon") permits only [olive oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_oil "Olive oil") (Mishnah Shabbat 2).

In Ancient Greek, it was used to refer to any sort of [petroleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum "Petroleum") or [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(resin) "Pitch (resin)"). The Greek word νάφθα designates one of the materials used to stoke the fiery furnace in the [Song of the Three Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_the_Three_Children "Song of the Three Children") (possibly 1st or 2nd cent. BC). The translation of Charles Brenton renders this as "[rosin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosin "Rosin")."

The naptha of antiquity is explained to be a "highly flammable light [fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation "Fractionation") of petroleum, an extremely volatile, strong-smelling, gaseous liquid, common in oil deposits of the Near East"; it was a chief ingredient in incendiary devices described by Latin authors of the Roman period.[7
