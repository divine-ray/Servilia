The development of electricity through the researchers in [[Duley and Port]] has been proven very crude and unrefined, but highly yielding. Some early applications, with the power made through [[Steam Turbines]] include electrical carriages on the [[Servilian Railroad and Train Network]] and supercharged weaponry, which has proven very violent against metallic targets. 

Someone attempted to connect a large rod directly to a generator, which created some *field*, which attracted various loose screws and other small things around. Following this, he tried to place another pole next to the main rod, which *somehow* produced current, despite not being connected to the main rod! 
He has been given research funds and supports, and seems to be on a rather promising route. A few [[Radio Equipment|prototypes]] have already been made, one of which integrated into [[Automatia]].
