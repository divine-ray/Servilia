A joint effort and collaboration between the [[Lavish]], [[Dragonkin|Dragon-kin]] and Humanity formed for the ultimate creation: a draconian-blooded humanoid, augmented with [[Pseudoneo]] biotechnology, who have dubbed themselves [[Varuú]]. 
They set out to become one with all, to constitute themselves atop everything, as a succcession of the failed attempts of the [[Nølkā]] to achieve [[Apotheosis]].
