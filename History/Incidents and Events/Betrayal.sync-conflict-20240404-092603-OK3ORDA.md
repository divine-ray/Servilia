The long-plotted and anticipated overthrowing and coup d'état of the fully functional and well-established democratic [[Council of Thylyist]]. 
Primary forces involved were the Highest [[Followers of Mekhane|Priests of Mekhane]] and their [[Gearforged Vanguard|Zealous Soldiers]]. 
Executed in the dead of night with the deadly precision of the long-prepared military, it was like Thylyist turned inwards outside. As if a malicious parasite finally burst out of its host, killing it, rearing its ugly head. 
The display of dogma and the embrace of regression, justified to be in the name of a greater good, which was absent at all time.
