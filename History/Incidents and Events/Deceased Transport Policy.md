A recently developed and enacted policy demands a regular interval of funeral trains to deliberately traverse identified [[Thin Veil|Thin Veils]], in order to aid the transportation of [[deceased]] souls and spirits.

Every month, every local department is expected to offer funeral services and mourners a round-trip to such a thin veil. Under guide and protection of a hired sorcerer or other qualified personnel, the mourners may disembark from the train and open the coffin, allowing that soul to depart beyond the veil and to their[[Afterlives]].

The amount of ghost sightings and related hauntings have notably receded not long after this enactment. 
Association representatives consider this a great success and milestone towards accustoming with the supernatural.
