## Hunter's Gatherings
Every Full Moon of Heaugi, all participating hunters gather up on a lodge within the Ninth Forest.
Bystanders (non-hunters) may use this opportunity to trade, as these gatherings represent a huge collection of gourmet game, pelts and weaponry. 

## Wanderer's Gathering
On each twelfth of a Month, Wanderers rally on a secret location that has been defined in the meeting before. Visiting these might provide valuable insights in suspected treasuries and other locations worth investigating.
