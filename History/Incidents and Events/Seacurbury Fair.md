A trade fair that is known in the entire continent, and is surely attracting plenty of visitors.
As far as I'm aware it's the greatest event of it's kind. 
The hosts spend all three moons preparing and teasing supplies to offer and sell. 
The greatest of all registered [[Gatherings]].

Organised on and in proximity to the [[Isle of Tankar]].
