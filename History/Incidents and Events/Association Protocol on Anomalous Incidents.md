*APAI*
As the [[Railroad and Trains of Servilia Assoc.]] regularly passes through thinly-woven areas, some things from [[Between]] may leak and disturb passengers. 
However, as commuters have grown accustomed to it, they became negligent of keeping up safety measures. Some travellers have not been seen again. 
People not used to the occasional thin weave usually consider the regulations and rules ridiculous. Only until they are met face-on with some of the incidents.  

Some Incident may force the train to halt at an illusory station in the wilderness, which easily fools the uninformed. 
Common other occurrences;
- Terrible weather, obscuring sight (fog, rainstorm).
- Sprites and other apparitions manifesting as passengers. 
- Grotesque monsters trying to enter the wagons whilst unable to interact with it. 
- Recently [[deceased]] entering and leaving the train at illusory stations. 
- Aforementioned [[Ghost Stations]].

After long studies with the aid of the [[Friscan Wizards]], the Association has developed and enforced a [[Deceased Transport Policy]].
