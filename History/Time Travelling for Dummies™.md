Idea: some Scientists (known as [[The Cradle]]) from [[Amida]] travel back in time and bring THEM^[who?] the capability to travel time or switch timelines.

TL;DR they will eventually arrive to cause the fall of [[The Second Era]], initiating the transition of Thylyist into Amida. ([[Downfall of Thylyist]])

%% #TODO Gotta balance this shit lmao%%

Possibly an ancient artefact, maybe  time-linked [[Riftstones]] would allow for the initial contact.
