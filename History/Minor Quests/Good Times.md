Retrieve the Vacuum Cleaner and Permit for a citizen
# song
[SAMMY J]  
It was a Monday  
When we took the car  
And drove it to the shops-  
  
[RANDY]  
I think it was a Tuesday-  
  
[SAMMY J]  
I'm pretty sure it wasn't-  
No, you're right, it was a Tuesday  
  
[BOTH]  
Cause Derek had the permit  
  
[RANDY]  
It's a clear way on a Monday  
  
[SAMMY J]  
Yeah, but we parked there  

[BOTH]  
So it must have been a Tuesday  
  
[SAMMY J]  
When we took the car-  
  
[RANDY]  
Did Derek give that permit back?  
  
[SAMMY J]  
He said he'd leave it when he went to Queensland  
  
[RANDY]  
We should chase that up  
  
[SAMMY J]  
We will  
  
[BOTH]  
Still  
  
[SAMMY J]  
We were in the car  
  
[RANDY]  
Urgh...  

[SAMMY J]  
Driving to the shops-  
  
[RANDY]  
I'm serious, that permit wasn't cheap  
  
[SAMMY J]  
Relax, we'll get the permit back  
  
[RANDY]  
That's what you said about the vacuum cleaner  
  
[SAMMY J]  
Well that was different, he's got allergies  
  
[RANDY]  
Like what?  
  
[SAMMY J]  
You saw the rash!  
  
[RANDY]  
It's eczema  
  
[SAMMY J]  
He has to clean the carpet 'cause his cat's got hairy bollocks  

[RANDY]  
He should get that thing de-sexed  
  
[SAMMY J]  
He can't, he breeds them, it's his way of coping with a difficult divorce  
  
[RANDY]  
As far as I can see his only allergy is giving back the shit he borrows from his neighbours  
  
[SAMMY J]  
So we were driving north-  
  
[RANDY]  
I mean, the guy can still afford to go to [Noosa](https://genius.com/22557194/Sammy-j-and-randy-good-times/Noosa)  
  
[SAMMY J]  
Yeah, what's your point?  
  
[RANDY]  
He should just buy a vacuum cleaner  
  
[SAMMY J]  
Look, I leant it in good faith  
How was I to know  
He'd take it inter-state and give it to his niece for her first communion?  
  
[RANDY]  
I didn't know he had a niece!  
  
[SAMMY J]  
It's complicated, see, his sister had a friend that died  
She's barren so she felt obliged to care for her  
  
[RANDY]  
So it's not actually his niece?  
  
[SAMMY J]  
Well, not by blood  
  
[RANDY]  
That's even worse, I can't believe he gave our vacuum cleaner to a random stranger!  
  
[SAMMY J]  
So we were driving north-  
  
[RANDY]  
South  
  
[SAMMY J]  
South towards the-  
  
[RANDY]  
North?  
  
[SAMMY J]  
No, it was northern suburbs  
  
[RANDY]  
South?  
  
[BOTH]  
That's right  
The map was upside down, but  
We got there in the end  
  
[SAMMY J]  
And parked outside the fish and chip shop  
  
[RANDY]  
Fruit shop-  
  
[SAMMY J]  
Milk bar-  
  
[RANDY]  
Hardware?  
  
[BOTH]  
Bake-- no, haberdashery  
It's next door  
  
[RANDY]  
To the house and home shop  
  
[SAMMY J]  
We went in and bought a vacuum cleaner  
  
[BOTH]  
When we came outside  
[We had a parking fine](https://genius.com/25206686/Sammy-j-and-randy-good-times/We-had-a-parking-fine)  
  
[RANDY]  
'Cause Derek had the permit  
  
[SAMMY J]  
He said he'd give it back!  
  
[RANDY]  
He didn't!  
  
[SAMMY J]  
Evidently!  
  
[RANDY]  
I won't be paying that!  
  
[SAMMY J]  
I'm trying to tell a fuckin' story  
  
[RANDY]  
Well, tell it then  
  
[SAMMY J]  
I will  
  
[RANDY]  
Good!  
  
[SAMMY J]  
I'm telling it right now!  
  
[RANDY]  
Oh he's telling it!  
  
[SAMMY J]  
Yes I'm trying to!  
  
[RANDY]  
Well go on, tell it!  
  
[SAMMY J]  
Fine I'll tell it!  
We were driving  
Home after the shops  
  
[RANDY]  
But when we pulled into the driveway  
  
[SAMMY J]  
Felt a bump  
  
[RANDY]  
Got out  
  
[BOTH]  
And realised we'd run over Derek's cat  
Who was being held  
By Derek at the time  
We took the permit from his cold, dead hands and ran away  
Good times!
