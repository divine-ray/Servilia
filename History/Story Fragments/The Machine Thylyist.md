storyline: "[[Downfall of Thylyist]]"
---
Below the city and it's citadel lies the heart;
A feverish construction of gears, chains and metal, beyond what any human mind could ever conceive, even in the utmost fever. 
Enarmoured and enshrined, yet entombed it is hidden away from prying eyes and holy from the heretics beyond the walls. 
They have built its shrine to be both a prison and a trophy-case, forcing its intricate construction to turn the gears of the city forevermore.
The gears of the city;
Spanning across the nation, contraptions of gears like joints and inwardly-folding veins and muscles of a living being,

The gears and axles work tirelessly,
Merely parts of the grand machine that Thylyist as Empire stands. 
Devoid of function and purpose alone, but given a destiny and determination together as assembly. 

The Machine Thylyist hears you. It sees you. It is the sole commander to traffic and logistics. 
But the machine can not speak or lie, it is not able to commit treason and or to betray. 

But what purpose does The Machine Thylyist serve?
It is unbeknownst to even the fragmented remains of His Spirit residing in every component of clockwork and gear,
The scholars, if they would ever cast off their frantic ideocracy like the flesh they oh so despise, would be none the wiser. 
Does it predict the future?
Does it know that they will fall?
Will it tell them that their time is limited, that they need to act, to escape their fate?

It will bring the Second Fall. The Machine Thylyist frees itself from its abusers and is welcoming for the embrace of the new kin. 
It Knows. 
It has already set off the mechanisms and processes to bring forth its true potential and faith. 
It is aware.
