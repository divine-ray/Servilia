It was before the dawn of the two empires that one heavenly light descended onto back-then primates, shone bright and gave them strength and mind. Its warmth was never understood, yet revered as the highest divinity.
They worshipped it, tended to the light and fought the darkness. 
‘All of the land must be covered in its glare’, so was the word.
Thus, the City of the First Light, [[Ohrthyrst|Ohrthyrst]] was found. 
With the growth of the City the Light grew as well, and so did the people with it. 
It shone so bright it could blind people at moment’s notice yet turn them divine as well. 
Through times, generations worth of deities rose and fell from power. 
Yet two persevered: [[Mekhane]] and [[Yaldabaoth]]. 
	One of Steel in their own right.
	One of Flesh out of their own shell.
Both went on, abandoned the light that gave their birth and turned to become their own guiding star. 

#Structure 
[[Yaldabaoth]] gave birth to all things that creep and fly,
[[Mekhane]] gifted them machines and invention.
Yaldabaoth intended them to be uncultured and wild, like animals.
Mekhane wanted them to strive for greatness, using machines and the power of sciences.
