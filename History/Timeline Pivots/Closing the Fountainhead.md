Â 

Closing down the [[Fountainhead]] allows the [[Twilit]] to unfold its natural state again, unharnessed, but possibly more awake than before and thus more conversing. This process takes time, and it'll never truly regain it's prome state, as the [[Echoes]] and [[Twilit Rift]]s manifest the tangible trauma caused by the millenia-long bloodletting. 

This would equate to freeing a human being from constant torment whilst sedated, a truly miserable state to be in. 

However, such action is not without consequences; as it is the Fountainhead that erected and stabilises the [[Hollow Mountains]] and [[Floating Islands]] in their current state. Such a decision would have to be made cautiously, since a hastily act would bring severe cataclysm to the lands. 

The [[Ancients]] would, however, be freed, and their derivates of Nolkan apotheoitic powers would greatly benefit the general populace to cast and weave magic.
