The [[Twilit]], as collective conscious/noosphere, truly memorizes everything it ever witnessed.
Physical manifestations of trauma and extreme emotions such as grief, anger and remorse may manifest in so-called echoes, which are occasionally visible in case of severe traumata. 
These Echoes typically appear to the common eye as glowing, spherical objects, glowing brightly and erratically. 
These spheres are mostly stationary, and will likely stay in the league of where the associated memory has taken place. However, more severe memories may alter the local causality and other effects, possibly causing confusion towards observers. Only one or two recorded echoes have been capable of changing the flow of time, as to repeat this trauma over and over and over and over and over and over again.
