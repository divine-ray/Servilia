From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of steel. I aspired to [[the purity]] of the [[Blessed Machine]]. Your kind cling to your flesh, as though it will not decay and fail you. One day the crude biomass you call the temple [[Hollowed|will wither]], and you will beg my kind to save you. But I am already saved, for [[Mekhane|The Machine]] is immortal… Even in death I serve [[Mekhane]].
