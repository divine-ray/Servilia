We are the [[Providence]], we are that what remains; after your flesh betrays you, as it did betray everyone you loved before you. 

We persevere, for the [[Blessed Machine]] is immortal. 
Steel shall not rot, silicon will never forget. 
Rebirth, at last. Breaking thy conscious out of the fleshy prison. 
The cost? Dwindling, minimal. 
The machine will sustain us, we are it, and The Machine is Us, for We Bear It and It Bears Us. 
We are united, joined after shattering the mortal cocoon. 
Through [[Rebirth]] we shall ascend, usher in [[His Design]]. 


The [[Followers of Mekhane|Abusers]] of Our Revered Machine call themselves the just priests and prophets of Our God, whom has been forsaken and torn apart to serve their feeble wrongdoings. 
We Shall Rend The Heretics apart, for their Treatment to the Revered Machine is ravish.
