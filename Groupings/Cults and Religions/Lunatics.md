#Lunatics #Religion  #Faction 

The deranged and off brand sorcerers residing in [Stargard](City%20of%20Stargard).
Capable of teaching the party the magic of the stars, ~~star signals~~ if they can understand them (must know ancient, celestial and draconic) and are resilient to the memetic corruption they give off.
They are rather skilled in optics, masonry and glassblowing, as their magic requires them to be. 
Possibly the most 'stable' population of gifted people, as their society is rather isolated and not too open for letting in strangers. 

We reach for the dark seas and oceans above with our telescopes, and one day, we will sail these seas we are trapped to solely observe. 
 
Some of them replaced their [[Iron Oculus|eyes]] with crystalline lenses or similar implants, designed to view the sky with higher quality than the ordinary eye.
Highly afraid of light, and nocturnal.
At times they scowl at the sheer mention of light.

They are somewhat able to predict future events by calculating celestial body alignment. Through this, they saw *things* that took most of their sanity.
They can offer valuable information if their babble and insanity can be deciphered.
