#Children-of-the-Flame #Cult 
 

The children of the flame, worshippers of the flaming [[Crimson Heart]] feeding on sacrificed Amarisk (precisely the burst of Amarisk released on death).
The bodies or physical appearance of the higher up cultists get slowly undergoes pyrolysis/cremation into animate figures of ashes.
	A sign of progressing cremation is the loss of a functional skeleton, which usually is "celebrated" by a full 360° turn of the head.
High-ranking individuals are revered as [[Ashen]]. 

They are on their way to developing a solution to the [[Curse of the Undead]] by restoring the embers of life and motivation within them through the fire they wield, which they rarely sell to the highest bidder. 
However, the majority of their ranks have become twisted and warped, aiming at misconducted "purification" through incineration of the poor undying instead, causing them a horrible reputation. 
The only faction capable of producing [[Bottled Embers]], [[Splinter of Blazes]] and [[Bottled Smoulders]].

> The CoTF caused the Blaze, the process of entities becoming Ashen.
> Something something the flame burns them until they're ashes

 


Ashen ones are quite allergic and disliking towards water since it screws up their entire body and shape.

Archenemy towards [[The Cold]] and the [[Red Plague]], despite being all-too-similar, if not related.
