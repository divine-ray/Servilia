That what remains of the faith who used to wage wars, to slaughter, to create using elemental forces. 
Now they have been reduced to a tiny, secretive chapter. But their influence and reach is not to be underestimated, as they remain pivotal to the [[Council of Thylyist]]. 
It is them who declared the [[Nølkā]] as Foul, them who war against the Confederation, those who are lost in delusion and self-righteousness.
Even in their scattered communities, the single grouping that buried itself into the innards of Thylyist is still a most corrupt imitation of the once-great religion and faith.

Those communities have, through happenstance, formed an unlikely organisation known as the [[Iron Monasteries]], in which they practice their faith to this day. 
The monasteries despise how the wicked, vile splinter that calls themselves the Mekhanites turned their own faith into a tool to enslave and dictate over Thylyist, to kill and maim in the name of Our God whom they killed to desecrate His Remains, in the name of a greater good, which the ordinary people will never see.
