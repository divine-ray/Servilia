Post-Revolution [[Empire of Thylyist]] which caused major turnovers in cultural and social norms, which led to a very liberal but unstable culture and population.
The downfall (and execution) of most of the [[Council of Thylyist]] also lifted the veil that propaganda was shaping around magic and the outside world
- Huge leaps in technological development due to incorporated [Lavish](The Lavish Empire) technology salvages and the beginning of [[Arcane Engineering]] and artificial life sciences (in human culture)
With the newfound expertise and drive they sought out to finally handle the [[Fountainhead]] in a deal with the [[Twilit]]
	→ some alternative link to empower 'our' (the material) world

The government is de-facto [[Board of Amida-Seven|controlled by Corporations]], which neglected civil protection and law enforcement for most of their reign, which led to chaos, [[Organised Crime]] and very liberal individual rights and downfall of most hesitations (i.e. it is common to walk barely nude, or barely tolerated to engage in sex on the open). 
Crime gangs empowered themselves to be the second government, mostly unscathed and otherwise dodging the feeble and underfunded the attempts of the corporations. 
Poverty is common, and food is scarce. 

[[Ancients]] got unexiled (probably) due to [[Fountainhead]] modifications 
[[Lavish]] technology (re-)enabled the modification of life, which led to the stereotypical implant culture of cyberpunk scenarios and to extremely durable semiorganic creatures, which got used to erect the space elevator in the centre of Sector 9
- intense space colonialism with the capability of easy space-faring
- possibly discovered a [Lavish](The Lavish Empire) colony within [[Heaugi]]'s oceans, who are defending their refuge with extreme means and violence

Amida as megacity has lifted the Thylyian dogma against non-human[^1] sentience, but ghettos and racism is still a daily issue and major source of criminality.
[[Varuú]] people still reside in their busted society in the Ninth Forest, but some deviants (Dark elves?) moved to Amida.

#### ![[Numerator]]

Furries (sapient anthropomorphic humanoids) exist in [[Amida-8]] due to a leak that involved the full genome of all major humanoid species and instructions to modify it, which led to a subset of rippers that went all-in and modified humanoid genomes, partly resulting in abominations, but also creating furries.

Addresses are given in XYZ coordinates of that sector relative to the numerator core (0|0|0)
