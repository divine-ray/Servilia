*Strategic Planning and Coordination Department*
The Thylyian Military, led by a small group of wealthy and otherwise influential people, including city-famous merchant guild leaders or [[Followers of Mekhane|Mekhanites]]. 
More-so the collection of the [[Followers of Mekhane|Mekhanite]] Priests and devotees, which use the military as means to zealotry and religious imperialism and enforcement. Partisans are highly valued within their council, and trained. 

Their position of power allows them to evade their own stigmata against magic, so the highest-ranking within this already-peaking group violate their own sermons and turned to the [[True Machinists]] for extending their lifespan. 
Execution/elimination of individuals that turn unfavourable or suspicious is common, and a favourite way of ridding someone is falling out of windows. 
## Organisation, Hierarchy 
### 1. The [[High Conclave]]
... Has been in power since the [[Fall of the Lavish]], is to blame for the events of [[The Second Era]].
The highest unit of command and power in the Military. 
Most significant, those cover up the extinction of the Lavish, the propaganda and doctrine (against the arcane), and the techno-cultural regression and isolation/fortification.
