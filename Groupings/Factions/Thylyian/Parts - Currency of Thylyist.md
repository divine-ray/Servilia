Imperial Currency of the [[Empire of Thylyist]], accepted as currency within Thylyist.
	Other countries scowl at these, but grudgingly accept them for their raw material value. 
 

Businesses typically store and transport their parts mounted on Axles.
Individuals tend to carry their parts in small leather bags or chainmail pouches.

Given the high price and regulated number of axles in circulation, they are seen as investment and treated akin to ingots of rare metals (gold, silver, platinum) on Terra.

Ducts is the most common part for everyday commerce, pinions and cogs are mostly used for investment or high expenses, whereas shims equate to loose change.
