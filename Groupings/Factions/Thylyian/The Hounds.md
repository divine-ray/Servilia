Covert assassination unit in the [[Gearforged Vanguard]], solely consisting from captured [[Pseudoneo]] quadrupeds from past the [[Betrayal]]. 
Their handlers are under direct control and obey to the [[Dogs of War]]. 

They are *extremely* violent, or rather, have been abused and trained to be so, and are stored within a own high-security sector in the Armory. 
In spite and total disrespect to any sort of sentience these beings once held, the [[War Constructors]] modified few into what is best described as precursor to a walking main battle tank, armed to the brim and overburdened with armour plating. 
This violence is the reason why civilians suspected of resistance seemingly disappear overnight.. 
 They got torn to shreds. 
Likely the second-highest secret of the Thylyian Military, if not **the** highest.
