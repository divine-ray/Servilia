#Ancients 
The descendants of the long-gone [[Nølkā]], now accustomed to their involuntary [[Ancient Exile]], after suffering ground-shattering defeats following the [[Nølkā-Mekhanite War]]. 
Their Humanity long gone; abandoned in favour of perfection and strive for power amongst their own ranks, brewing and scheming their stealthy return. 
Their society resembles a closed-down ethnostate, hostile towards those who express any intent to join their ranks. 
Commonly dubbed the New Gods, for the [[Nølkā]] [killed, devoured](Theophagy.md) and effectively replaced the long-established [[Universal Pantheon]]. Despite this title, no group is officially worshipping and revering to them, as their rise to power is seen as foul and cheated on. 

No resident there has been born with these powers; each has [taken the greatest sacrifice](Apotheosis.md) to achieve their powers. 
Possibly the ethnic group with the best twilit conductance, as they have been practising eugenics and breeding for it since ages. 

Possibly all retired lvl 20 adventurers ascend into their circles.

Gradam Cant is their form of catalysing raw Amarisk into working.
(Lit. Ancient Language)

They have a approx 0.25x scaling on reputation gain.

Forcibly contained by the [[Fountainhead]], as to limit their actions.
