A semi-amorphous organism residing in the [[Northern Reaches]] of the Realm, especially the Poles. It feeds on thermal energy (heat), [[Twilit]] and Amarisk residues. 
This peculiar organism is mostly responsible for the anomalously harsh weather in the northern reaches, aided by the [[Horn of Blizzards]].

Dubbed "Cryosphara" by local worshippers and [[Ghiaccia Conclave|cultists]] alike, most of these groups being incorporated in the [[Empire of Winds]]. 

Archenemy towards the [[Children of The Flame]], as their goals are antipolar. 

It's main way of existing is to convert any matter into its own tissue, which is necrotic and frozen: [[Premature Heart of Cold]], [[Ice Cub]]. 

Small patches (like, 20g, 5x5x5cm) can survive on their own and possibly develop into independent instances.

# Third Era utilisation
[[Numerator]]s and the rediscovered Lavish biotechnology made it possible to harness the various qualities of Cold tissue, while somewhat being able to tame the drawbacks. 
Cold tissue finds widespread application in high-temperature machinery where resilient cooling is required and within numerators, where it's stem-cell pluripotency is utilised to shape the central infrastructure of Numerators.
