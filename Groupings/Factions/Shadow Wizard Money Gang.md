A loose, rag-tag band of people who are somehow skilled in the ways of weave and twilit, and filled with pure malicious intent and greed. <br>
%%who? what? why? how?%%
They tend to only appear in the shallower coastal zones, using small rowboats or tiny sailing vessels. The few sightings^[who saw them?] described them as terrifyingly coordinated and strategic, despite their poor and worn out appearances. <br> In repeated occasions, they have intercepted high-value transports, almost as if they are in possession of leaks and espionage secrets. 
These wizards off the coasts are considered a scourge by other seafaring folk and persecuted enemy of the confederation.
