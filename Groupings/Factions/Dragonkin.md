# Profile: [[Kva'al]]

Loosely organised groups and families with little to no hierarchy.
These groups tend to be associates such as families, partners and friends
Not a cluster of tribes since groups form and dissolve easily (aside from familial associations).

Some lesser settlements and such exist on the [[Right Ribs]], but they're less populated and generally more endangered through human activities. 
#### Government
"Capital City" [[Skalitz]] (moreso a hub of trades, services and housing) located on the [[Ka√°-Rav|Left Ribs]]. 
True neutral in global politics for the most parts outside of self-preservation and security (since they're lacking a central government) 

#### Chromatic outliers
Few exceptions in violent chromatic dragons who wage conquest and war for their own benefit and riches. 
These few outliers shape the negative image of all dragonkin, resulting in many "Kill on Sight" orders
Dragonkin is subjected to genocide attempts by the [[Council of Thylyist]] and it's military.
The attackers have been horribly defeated repeatedly.  
	Yet they keep on trying.
