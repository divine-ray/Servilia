# Profile: #Lavish 

This water-bound species shaped the once-dry [[Palga Basin]] into a massive body of water, sustaining their life.
Settled within [[Syksa, Lavish Capital]]. 
### Decscription of the Species:
![[Lavish]]

### Communication 
Their primary means of communication were telepathy and changing the colour of their skin. Secondarily is the ejection of a pheromone and ink mixture that acts as longer term messages.
A breakthrough in their development has been the development of implants that allow coordinated long distance communication.

Ever since their primordial ancestors, these beings were highly competent with biology and a relic of old times were symbiotic relations to bacteria cultures that enable their bioluminescence.
Adult individuals each fostered a colony of bacteria and other microbiological life, which define a unique signature to others and enable them to transmit complex, self-propagating messages.

It is speculated that they could only advance so far due to the water shielding them from the intense solar emission, which likely complicates [[Empire of Thylyist]] sciences.

## Technology and Magic
The Lavish were responsible for building the [[Fountainhead]].
They wielded great arcane powers and bonded to the twilight, until they constructed the Fountainhead and tore a hole into the [[Twilit]].

They engineered most of the [transport systems](Argrosy) in Thylyist and Servilia.

### Supercollider Antimatter power project::
![[SC-AM]]



So, the lavish people had created Rapture (BioShock) x Fallout Vaults

> Now what if... the Thylyian were really really jealous about the Lavish having access to Silicon technologies and being overall superior to them? Especially their grande feat of fusing magic and technology?
