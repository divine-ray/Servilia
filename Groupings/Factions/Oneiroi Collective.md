Those sleeping, those who forfeit their mental fortitude to the waves and tides of rest. 
The dreamers, the sleepers, the resting. 
They are the collective; the cumulus cloud of unhindered minds and souls, unchained by censorship of a Self, unbound by a frail body.  ^3bce86

Within the clouds and waves float hopes and terrors alike, dipping and drowning across ethereal fabric, intangible by all.
