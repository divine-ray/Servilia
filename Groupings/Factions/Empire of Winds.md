A anarchic tribal cluster of winged, [sentient beings](Songbird.md), residing in the [[Northern Reaches]] and the [[Crevice Canyons]]. Certainly distinct from [Songbirds](Songbird.md) and self-distinguished from the [[Avian Renegades]], these creatures adapted and modified themselves towards ideal lethality and efficiency. 
They've made themselves into extremely agile hunters, and are cultured as such. Due to the nature of their home, they're virtually unable to leave their territories due to perfect adaptation to their realm.

Once within the families of songbirds, these extremes-seeking outcasts changed and turned themselves towards the harsh, brutish wilderness. 
It is them, out of all pseudoneo, who fled the purpose-slavery dictated by the lavish, them who understood their own form and the ways to change it. The Empire of Winds taught the [[The Lavish Empire|Lavish Empire]] to regret their choices in giving their creations freedom. 

Calling them an Empire is a vast overestimation by the few travellers who made it back alive from the northern reaches, but their widespread tribal nature easily gives way to the illusion of a well-organised and sweeping empire. 


Not much is known of these oftentimes violent hunters. Yet, some of the most daring gangs and organisations have praised them for being ideal mercenaries and killing squadrons, but their stealth and covert operations are severely lacking, as they typically hit hard and heavy. These hired hit-creatures remain a myth and legend amongst human-run gangs and such, as the few sightings reported have been made by badly-wounded and traumatised survivors. 

Those few who manage to fight through the deadly conditions of the Northern Reaches oftentimes get adopted into their ranks in a own, special caste.
It is also this gang sheltering the [[Ghiaccia Conclave]]. This uneasy alliance was born out of blood-thirst for power on behalf of the [[Ventus]] to savour the powers of [[The Cold]].
