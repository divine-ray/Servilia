A loose group of first-generation songbirds, who broke their shackles (both metaphorically and physically) from the Lavish.
Seen more times than not around the [[Dwarves]], as they source their parts from the dwarven machinations. 
They're the only known songbirds that can reproduce solely by themselves. 
Ancestors to the [[Empire of Winds]], as they are built tough and enduring. 
The main 'tribe' is only found occasionally, as they live a nomadic life around Servilia. Despite that, they still allow themselves to get hired for a pretty penny- er, commodity, since they do not understand currency.
