#Location 
Kva'al is the independent Community of Dragonkin, residing on the upper half of [[Ka√°-Rav]], around the [[Right Ribs]] and [[Hollow Mountains]]. 
During the [[The Second Era]], most full-blood dragons have more or less been forcibly moved to here, as the Thylyist martial law ruined the reputation of dragonkin. 

Their densest settlement is [[Skalitz]].
