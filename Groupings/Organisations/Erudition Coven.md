A mostly unknown, now forgotten, coven of literate scholars and other educated individuals, who dedicated their life and efforts towards establishing time-resistent installations for preserving knowledge. 
In today's time, they have vanished and activities have stopped, but their biggest works remain:
The [[Archive of Old]], in which they documented all the gathered history and folklore, down to the individual citizen since the inception of time and mankind.
The [[Elemental Libraries]], who hold knowledge on the ways of each element known, and how to tame them.

We, the Covern of Knowledge, pride ourselves in the noble yet humble task of collecting and gathering knowledge from all around the world. 
We wish and strive for that everyone may read, write and inform themselves in our books. 
Knowledge is the virtue we gift upon the world.
