The company and association singlehandedly holding the monopoly on rail-based transportation of and around Servilia. Headquartered in Frisco, Bay Confederation.
Colloquially dubbed 'the Railroad', 'Train Association' and several more by townsfolk and employees alike. 
Primarily operates coal-fired steam trains, but has pushed into electrification due to [[several fatal incidents]].  
A recent issue dubbed the [[Thin Veil|Thin Veils]] has arisen, which forced the directors to enact the [[Association Protocol on Anomalous Incidents|Anomaly Protocol]]. 

A single train using the deadly but boiling [[hot rocks]] acquired from [[Blighthurst]] has been conceived, but never built. 
%%They know about the massive uranium deposit, but have no means of enriching it and just know that the pitchblende/uraninite can boil water under certain circumstances.%%

The independent development of Duley's [[Duley Tunnel Rail|Tunnel Rail]], with it's rapid adoption, has sent the association into a mild panic as they try to uphold their monopoly on railroad transport. Public rumours blame several accidents and disasters of the tunnel rail on sabotage from the Railroad. 

Major stations include:
- Frisco
- [[Brisburne]]
- ~~[[Sepulchre]]~~ (Partially, but necessary to balance the load and shorten general travel times.)
%%Descent of second era: A station for Anor is planned, but negotiations with the Dwarves are ongoing.%%
