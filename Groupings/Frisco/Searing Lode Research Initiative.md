A voluntary initiative created by local associations of engineers and universities of [[Duley and Port]] to evaluate the impact and potential uses of the [[Searing Lode]]. 
Primarily assembled after a government grant had been promised to those who could resolve the death and subsequent desolation of [[Blighthurst]], as there has been a suspected connection for a prolonged time. 
Their prime project has been the Hot Rock Core for [[Automatia]], which has been declared lost. 

Has, unwillingly, become target of [[Frisco Universal Oil]] as the potential applications of Hot Rocks appear near-universal once the health issues are resolved.
