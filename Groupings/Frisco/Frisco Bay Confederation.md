The confederation and allegiance spanning the mostly-autonomous cities and rural areas of the [[Frisco Bay]].
In the modern age, cooperation and peace treaties have earned the Confederation a remarkable prestige amongst the nonhuman civilisations such as the [[Kva'al]] and [[Sepulchre]]. 
Founded in 22-03-1377 (22th Bakk), the Confederation can proudly and rightfully claim to have advanced beyond Thylyist. The Treaty of Unity, in which the Confederation is officially declared, allowed each major city to specialise, which is part of why the Confederation is so prosperous nowadays. 
Structurally similar to Thylyist (Several villages, towns and other lesser settlements swallowed by urban sprawl), they differ in the biggest part that each city and village is mostly self-governed, and act as autonomous state/sub-unit. 
This mostly preserved the regional identity and culture of each city, but massively strengthened their economy and military strength.
