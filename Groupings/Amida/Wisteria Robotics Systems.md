A rather recently founded and incorporated company specialised around [[MECH Units]].  
They have been steadily erasing their own history records and spreading misinformation about their origin, to disguise and mask over the fact that they split off violently from [[APAS Ltd.]]. This conflict was among the first larger inter-corpo skirmishes fielding weaponised MECH units. 

The division dedicated to MECH-mounted weaponry is called Wisteria Arms Research Division. 
The ~~split~~ incorporation is so recent that the number of employees and affiliated personnel is hardly in the thousands. However, this is Amida's elite of scientific and technical personnel, partially headhunted from the other corpos, partially recruited from the underground. 

Rumour has it that WRS is utilising moles and undercover agents in [[Organised Crime]] groups and other... dubious formations that may develop technology in questionable ways and environments.
