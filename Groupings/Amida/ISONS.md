Intra-Sector Organisation of Numerator Security

The executive branch or division of the [[Board of Amida]] which unifies the military, police and law enforcement, under direct control of the [[Echelon]] and [[Cluster]] to enforce order(ish) within the sectors.

Infamous for being ruthless and careless of the lives of civilians, oftentimes exerting over-the-top violence. 
Primarily employs C.3-Restricted [[MECH Units]] instead of humanoid troops for total control.
