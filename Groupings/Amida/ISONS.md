ISONS
Intra-Sector Organisation of Numerator Security

Tasked with enforcing order and safety for the numerators and their components. 
Infamous for being ruthless and careless of the lives of civilians, oftentimes applying more force and armament than necessary. 
Primarily employs C.3-Restricted [[MECH Units]] instead of humanoid troops for total control. 
The MECHs are directly linked to a subpersona/subroutine of the respective numerator intellect. 

ISONS refers to the organisation body that is present across all Numerators, but due to the individual nature of sector legislation, they all have their own divisions with differing legislation and enforcement.
