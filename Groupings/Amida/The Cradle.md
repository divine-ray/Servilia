The Cradle is a decently sized group of researchers specialised in temporal studies, part of [[adAstra SocInstitute]]. 

[[Project Silverspoon]] has begun and a truce for dominion between the corporations has temporarily been established to ensure collaboration towards this existentially relevant goal. 

The “Cats”, as the anonymised members of the cradle are called (partially literal due to anthropomorphism and [[Cyberware]]), are trying to send information back in time to a gullible group to initiate a butterfly effect. 

> Do they give the engineers of Thylyist blueprints for time machines or do they actually travel to our time themselves?
