 

The Cradle is a decently sized group of researchers specialised in temporal studies, part of [[adAstra SocInstitute]]. 
Recent results of their studies have revealed that the timeline of [[Amida]] will experience termination and dissonance if not for the [[Talking 'bout a Revolution|collapse of the Thylyian Empire]].
#TODO 
	Instabilities in the rehabilitated, healing twilit “delivered“ documents and snippets of other timelines, in which Amida was never founded and Thylyist still stands, albeit in a possibly different state. 
In secret, the cradle has been given broad funding by the [[Board of Amida|Board]] to guarantee the continued existence of their timeline.
[[Project Silverspoon]] has begun and a truce for dominion between the corporations has temporarily been established to ensure collaboration towards a mutually profitable goal. 

The “Cats”, as the members of the cradle are called (partially literal due to anthropomorphism and [[Cyberware]]), are trying to send information back in time to a gullible group to initiate butterfly effects. 

 

> Do they give the engineers of Thylyist blueprints for time machines or do they actually travel to our time themselves?
