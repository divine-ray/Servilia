The Balatro is a loose, largely unidentified group of [[MECH Units]], which somehow managed to circumvent their [[Throttling]] to abandon their objectives and overwhelm their operators. 
Said operators are no longer resembling humans, being closer to [[Host|Hosts]] of numerators than independent, dignified people, having their mind broken and serving as processing substrate. 

Current observation data is too sparse to make out any certain motives, goals or methodology, as they have not been seen often. 

However, all MECHs of this grouping took on a very striking visual identification: adorning their hulls with scraps and equipment resembling clowns and jesters from the [[Time of Old]], along with a very striking colour pattern: purple-blue-green and blue-red. No meaning outside of the referencing could be matched to these colours. 
In all appearances, they left plenty of graffiti resembling the letter M behind.
