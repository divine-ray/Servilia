<h2 id="towns-and-cities">Towns and Cities</h2>
<ul>
<li>Greenhome: A two-storey stone-walled building which has been completely overgrown by flowering vines, with scale-like leaves and thorny, writhing branches. It is the home of Nina, a young green dragon sage.</li>
<li></li>
<li>The Earth Shrine: A wondrous monolith of precious stone, said to hold the ruby heart of the world. On every full moon, dew hued in the colour of that moon condenses on it. Local folks say it is crying.</li>
<li>The ruins of a seven-sided tower, which appears restored upon the night of the new moon.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gallows Tree: A long-dead ironwood tree, said to be haunted by the ghosts of the thieves and murderers which once hung from it.
THIS FOR THE TWO HANGMEN</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An elegant dwarven inn, which is said to have a thousand doors in a thousand towns, each under a different sign and name. Anyone who enters through a particular door can only leave through that same door, unless they know the <em>innkeeper</em>&rsquo;s secret.
Each house shares some similarities with the other houses, but not enough to differ from the local architecture and culture. Almost like secret codices allow for easy spotting of these inns and taverns.</p>
<p>One door remains particularly interesting; framed with polished white marble, of a strangely black wood, embossed with greenish-yellow metal. The wood seems like charcoal, yet is tough as a freshly felled tree.
<em>Just open the door.</em>
But it won&rsquo;t let itself be opened, it resists.
Patrons of the inn gossip about voices beyond the door, strange noises, but those remain rumours. They drank too much. Yes, they had too much beer.
But I want to investigate what&rsquo;s behind the door, it&rsquo;s causing me restless nights,
and the few times I sleep
I dream the same dream, of opening it with ease, but waking up just before the mechanism swings open.
Let me open the door.
I need to know what is behind this door.
This is killing me, <strong>let me open the door.</strong>
%%so apparently both the inn of thousand doors and the zubin society access the <em>Oneiroi Collective</em> and/or the twilit, but noone knows
having several groups act towards a shared goal independently sounds quite interesting, especially when they meet%%</p>
<ul>
<li>The Pool of Radiance: A small pool of water, which glows with a flickering blue light. It is said to be haunted by a malevolent spirit, waiting for a worthy creature to possess. The local townsfolk avoid it.</li>
<li>The Temple of Ariel, God of Plants: An impressive terraced building, decorated with carved friezes and golden inscriptions.</li>
<li>The Shrine of Ilgad: A cauldron lamp enshrining the flame of Ilgad, God of the Sky, said to reveal visions to those who leave an offering.</li>
<li>The Water Shrine: A wondrous arch of clear water, said to reveal visions to those who drink from it.</li>
<li>James&rsquo; Armaments: A neglected weaponsmith&rsquo;s workshop, built around a shrine of Manael, Goddess of War.</li>
<li>The Broken Spear II: A shabby elven tavern, entirely managed by cats. Its name comes from being a perfect duplicate of The Broken Spear, another inn on the other side of town, from the building itself to its decor and even patrons.</li>
<li>The Stormspire: An obelisk of rune-carved stone, engraved with columns of arcane glyphs. Each time the spire is struck by lightning, it vanishes for exactly nine hours. Each time it returns, some of the glyphs have changed.</li>
<li>The House of Deseldo: A large half-timbered theatre, which has one door here and another in <em>Orhyrst, City of the First Light</em> .</li>
<li>The Dragon Stables: The original stalls of this huge stone-walled building were each large enough to hold a young dragon. They have been divided by wooden frames into horse stalls, which are hired out to merchants, pilgrims, and other travellers.</li>
<li>The Stone Dragon: A colossal petrified dragon stands over the street. It is said that the dragon will be made flesh again if any descendant of the wizard who imprisoned it passes by without leaving a coin.</li>
<li>The Sawmill: A derelict building of brick and slate, filled with complex dwarven machines. It is apparent that the building is a sawmill, but no-one has been able to work out how to operate it in many generations.</li>
<li>The Marut: An ancient cyclopean colossus of unweathered stone, where local merchants come to make contracts. It is said that anyone who breaks an oath sworn upon the Marut will be slain before the next dawn.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="items">Items</h1>
<h2 id="rods">Rods</h2>
<p>Surveyor&rsquo;s Rod (Rod):
While holding this rod, you know the distance to any fixed landscape feature you can see, such as a tree, mountain, oasis, castle, island, etc.</p>
<h2 id="wondrous-items">Wondrous Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bucket of Armor (Wondrous Item):
This simple wooden bucket is filled with scraps of leather and metal, and weighs 20 pounds. While you carry it in one hand, your base AC becomes 13 + your Dexterity modifier.</li>
<li>Bag of Candle Holding (Wondrous Item):
This bag can hold up to 100 kg (250 pcs.) of
candles, but weighs 15 pounds regardless
of its contents.  Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Mummer&rsquo;s Potion (Wondrous Item):
While wearing these white gloves, you can use an action to conjure tiny, invisible barriers of magical force, of the sort used by mummers for their theatre.  The effect lasts for as long as you concentrate on it, up to 10 minutes.  You can also use a reaction  to conjure a larger barrier to protect you, which gives you a +5 bonus to AC.  This ends the effect at the start of your next turn. The gloves can&rsquo;t be used this way again until the next dawn.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scrolls">Scrolls</h2>
<p>Origami Messenger (Scroll):
You can use an action to read this scroll, which causes it to fold itself into a tiny origami squid. The object will fly to a destination and deliver a message, as though you had cast the spell Animal Messenger (phb 212).</p>
<h2 id="rings-and-baubles">Rings and Baubles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Symbiotic Ring (Ring, requires attunement):
When you put this carved bone ring on, it becomes snug around your
finger and turns the colour of your blood.  While you are attuned to
the ring, you gain 10 temporary hit points daily at dawn.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="armour">Armour</h2>
<p>Scale Mail of the Serpent (Armor, scale mail, requires attunement):
While wearing this scale mail, you can use an action to speak its
command word.  The armour transforms into a giant constrictor snake, with you still inside it. The creature acts on its own initiative count and follows your mental commands.
The armour returns to its normal form when you use an action to speak the command word again, or if the creature is reduced to 0 hit points.  The armour can&rsquo;t be used this way again until the next dawn.</p>
<h1 id="prophecies-and-scriptures">Prophecies and Scriptures</h1>
<p><em>Orphanage of the Fane in the Empyrean Sky</em>. (Orphanage of the Church in Heaven)</p>
<h2 id="cyphers">Cyphers</h2>
<p>%%basically one-time use spells, they loose function/self-destruct afterwards. compatible with ommoran firearms, especially the RCL0.%%
Greater cyphers simply loose their power after activation, lesser cyphers shatter or disintegrate.
Superior cyphers may be used several times, but will discharge in a chain when force is acted upon it.
Greater cyphers may be &ldquo;recharged&rdquo; by re-applying their lost power/catalyst using a spell/ritual. Also applies for superior cyphers, as long as they remain intact.</p>
<h2 id="superior">Superior</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <em>smouldering</em>, raw shard of <em>bloody</em> ruby, with streaks of <em>glimmering embers</em> within it. Upon activation, it summons a fireball (6m sucessful dex save, 8d6 fire on fail, half on sucess) at either a desired or its own position (manual/thrown). It can cast up to eight fireballs before depletion.</li>
<li>A smooth and polished amber, containing a <em>tiny flame</em>.  Upon use, the amber turns ashen grey and a wall of inextinguishable flame emerges on the spot of activation, which can melt any metal.</li>
<li>A blueish-milky white icicle, with iridescent reflections playing on the surface.
Upon activation, it flash-freezes any substance until it&rsquo;s brittle in a radius of 3m. With each use, a centimetre of it melts away into common water, until the deep-frozen core at 15cm depletion remains (this equates to 5 uses).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="greater">Greater</h2>
<ul>
<li>A dragon&rsquo;s claw engraved with <em>glowing</em> symbols. When activated, the cypher grants the target advantage on attack rolls until the end of their next turn.</li>
<li>Grey Cypher:  A glass spindle filled with <em>silvery liquid</em>.  When broken over a weapon, the weapon is transmuted into a unknown metal.  It deals an additional 2d6 points of damage until the end of the session, after which the weapon disintegrates.</li>
<li>A jagged shard of emerald containing a <em>flickering flame</em>. When impaled into flesh, the cypher melts into eternal fire that lasts for a day.</li>
<li>A <em>broken</em> jade cube <em>warped by magic</em>. When thrown at a target, the cypher causes a small earthquake (knocked prone, Dex save negates).</li>
<li>A copper fragment smeared with <em>crimson blood</em>. When launched at a target, the cypher explodes with a thunderous bang (3d6 thunder damage and deafened, Con save half and negates).</li>
<li>A broken oaken staff <em>engraved with geometric patterns</em>. When held and activated, the cypher conjures a permanent wall of stone.</li>
<li>Crystal Fragment:  A large fragment of an obsidian sphere, containing a <em>shifting cloud of light</em>.  When held and activated, the cypher allows you to scry an individual creature known by name. However, you can only see their face.</li>
<li>A hydra&rsquo;s tooth engraved with <em>glowing symbols</em>. When activated, the cypher pushes all adjacent creatures fifteen metres away from the point of activation.</li>
<li>Cypher of the Iron King:  A jagged iron spike, <em>smeared with blood</em>. When impaled into the flesh of another creature, that creature becomes your thrall, as per the spell dominate person.</li>
<li>A moonstone fragment <em>warped by magic</em>. When thrown at a target, the cypher explodes into a cloud of noxious gas (3d6 poison damage and poisoned, Con save half and negates).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lesser">Lesser</h2>
<ul>
<li>A slender spindle of topaz containing a <em>mote of darkness</em>. When impaled into flesh, the cypher dissolves and causes localised acid burns, dealing 1d6 damage over 1d4 rounds.</li>
<li>A jagged shard of sapphire smeared with <em>black ichor</em>. When held and activated, <del>the cypher conjures a stone tower.</del></li>
<li>A platinum shard on a leather cord. When thrown at a target, the cypher destroys metal objects.</li>
<li>A jagged shard of sapphire on a chain of dark scales. When activated, the cypher conjures a creature of living shadow for 2d6 rounds.</li>
<li>A jagged shard of green crystal etched by acid. When impaled into flesh, the cypher dissolves and heals 4d8 hit points.</li>

<li>A malachite shard etched by acid. When thrown at a target, the cypher polymorphs it into a mouse, con save negates.</li>
<li>A Bamboo pipe, buzzing with wasps. When thrown, it bursts into a swarm of wasps.</li>
<li>A broken moonstone idol engraved with geometric patterns. When thrown at a target, the cypher conjures an area of invisibility.</li>
<li>A mangled platinum gauntlet damaged by flame. When worn and activated, the cypher grants you a +1 bonus on Intelligence saving throws for 1d6 rounds.</li>
