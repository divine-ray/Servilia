These collapse events are called ignitions, and a advanced species&rsquo; Amarisk sphere usually undergoes at least two ignitions. It&rsquo;s a event akin to a vacuum implosion, which causes a rapid expansion afterwards.

<h2 id="first-ignition">First Ignition</h2>
<p>After a significant buildup of <a href="Amarisk.md">Amarisk</a>, it will, as mentioned, collapse unto itself, creating a parallel dimension localised to it&rsquo;s planet and species.
If several sentient species are widespread on this planet, then the parallel dimension will take on a blend of properties of these species.
The <em>Pulastaya</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> of this planet acts as parental figure to this dimension and therefore said dimension will shape itself to their Pula.
In this state, the parallel dimension bears nothing but a feverishly dreamt materialisation of said impacting factors.</p>
<h2 id="second-ignition">Second Ignition</h2>
<p>A second ignition is soon to follow after the first; given that populace remained steadily growing, passively radiating <a href="Amarisk.md">Amarisk</a> into the layer.
However, this time around, the fold can be perceived by <em>sensitive individuals</em> and regulars alike, for it marks the birth of Sapience of This Layer.
Hereafter, the Layer has been described as <a href="......%5CRealms%5CPlanes%5CTwilit.md">Twilit</a>, as it resembles the &ldquo;true&rdquo; world yet degrading notable influences like artificial reshaping through man-made activities (buildings, mining, displacement of terrain, etc.). In addition, most species capable of shifting their perception into There have reported it to be devoid of colours.</p>
<p>The newborn Twilit is on the mental development of a freshborn, and will act as such towards stimuli, regardless of their origin.</p>
<p>This event seeds a rare genetic strain or trait among their species (assuming they are carbon and DNA based), that will enable these individuals to shift themselves, most times only partially, into this <a href="......%5CRealms%5CPlanes%5CTwilit.md">Twilit</a>.

<h2 id="further-ignitions">Further Ignitions</h2>
<p>Any further events are not known to cause more major events (in the human twilight).</p>
<p>They add more depth to the twilight, to store the excess Amarisk generated.</p>
