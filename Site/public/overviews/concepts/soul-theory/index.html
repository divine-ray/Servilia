    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Each soul is only a visitor from <em>A Realm Beyond</em>, only tied into the mortal shell.
Souls without any coherence and such enter a state of degenerate matter, known as <a href="Magic%20System%5CAmarisk.md">Amarisk</a> or <a href="....%5CGroupings%5CFactions%5CSpirits.md">Spirits</a>. Exposure to too much entropy and chaos can deteriorate souls, deform them until they cannot reside in a physical body anymore, but need special procedures (<a href="....%5CHistory%5CStory%20Snippets%5CBirth%20of%20Energy.md">Birth of Energy</a>) to be materialised.</p>
<p>This opens the questions of &ldquo;Where are souls formed?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where does amarisk gain coherence to become a soul?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is it possible to reverse the deformation of a soul?&rdquo;
And the question of &ldquo;Where does the soul go after the death of it&rsquo;s shell?&rdquo; is answered by the entire dilemma of the Undead and Charon being broken.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
That being the soul being unable to depart from the mortal vessel, thus being forced to reside in the decaying body which is leeching this soul&rsquo;s power.
The soul is facing progressing decay as its very energy is suspending the body, eventually leading to madness and frenzy if not ailed.</p>
<p>In case of extreme damage to the body under certain violent circumstances, the soul may escape the shell and eventually turn into a ghastly shape, much akin to <a href="....%5CGroupings%5CFactions%5CSpirits.md">Spirits</a>, filled with everlasting thirst of vengeance.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
