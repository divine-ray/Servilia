Caused by <a href="....%5CBeings%5CGods%20and%20Deities%5CCelestial%20Family%5CSchi%20ut-Pula.md">Schi ut-Pula</a>&rsquo;s depression and the devouring of Charon by the <em>Nølkā</em>.</p>

<p>It infects most if not all sentient beings, but mostly humanoids have been observed to succumb to it.
&lsquo;Infected&rsquo; people do not die in the traditional sense. Their body ceases to function in terms of metabolism and other otherwise deemed-essential biological processes, but the psyche remains functional and in control of the motive apparatus.</p>
<p>However, the mentality is prone to drastic changes under certain circumstances.
If the subject looses motivation or desire to strive on living or a purpose in their life, the lack of orientation will rapidly tear at their psyche and eventually leave them <a href="....%5CBeings%5CCreatures%5CHollowed.md">Hollowed</a>.
This state is akin to dementia or Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other neurodegenerative ilnesses, as it&rsquo;ll leave the individual personality torn apart and left to shreds, typically resulting in violent outbursts and disability to interact in reason with others.</p>
