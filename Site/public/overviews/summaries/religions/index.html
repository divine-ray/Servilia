<p>One of the two big religions ever formed in Servilia, this religion descended from the remnants of their once-great Mekhanite religion.
Originally created as direct worshippers of <a href="....%5CBeings%5CGods%20and%20Deities%5CMekhane.md">Mekhane</a>s will at the conception of Mankind, now turned into a lesser, deviated hodgepodge, in which their highest ranks assume the positions of dictatorship.
After the <em>Nølkā-Mekhanite War</em>, they broke down, scrambled at the destruction of their god, Mekhane. Having received the order to restore and <em>to put him back together</em>, they set out in massive reconissance operations to retrieve parts at all costs, but eventually gave up, eventually curling up into the <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CAreas%5CEmpire%20of%20Thylyist%5CEmpire%20of%20Thylyist.md">Empire of Thylyist</a>, a locked-down isolationist state where free speech and thought is rare.
As they seized the government through religious soliders and warriors, the empire of Thylyist entered a catatonic state of regression and standstill.</p>

<p>Disagreement in regards to teaching and execution of the holy scriptures within the Mekhanites has led rise to a new movement, who believe that the interpretation of the Mekhanites is against the design of the <em>Blessed Machine</em>.
Additionally, the adherents of the Machinists believe that the human flesh is inferior to the Machine, and thus seek to replace it through metal.</p>
<h2 id="nølkā"><em>Nølkā</em></h2>
<p>The other big religion, directly <a href="..%5CPrime%20Clash%20of%20Nolka%20vs%20Mekhanites.md">opposing</a> the Mekhanites. Mostly untied from a deity, but rather oriented around becoming their own gods through <a href="..%5CConcepts%5CApotheosis.md">Apotheosis</a>. Their only notable figure is their lost prophet, who attempted to topple and kill <em>Yaldabaoth</em>, the Chaos-Mother of Mankind.
Survived the War barely, now is scattered across the continent in loose village groups and within the <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CHollow%20Mountains%5CAncient%20Exile.md">Ancient Exile</a>.</p>
