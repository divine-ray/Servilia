<h3 id="padian-shadowmawbeingsspeciespadian20shadowmawmd"><a href="....%5CBeings%5CSpecies%5CPadian%20Shadowmaw.md">Padian Shadowmaw</a></h3>
<p>A mostly nocturnal species with little representation in the Kva’al community.
Oftentimes found living in isolation or off-limits, primarily around the astral ocean due to their nocturnal cycle matches with the nigh-constant nighttime of the ocean.</p>
<h3 id="ivory-highflyer"><em>Ivory Highflyer</em></h3>
<h2 id="pseudoneobeingsspeciespseudoneomd"><a href="....%5CBeings%5CSpecies%5CPseudoneo.md">Pseudoneo</a></h2>
<p>This peculiar collection of species has allegedly been created by the Lavish in their drive for expansion.
They share a common set of features, that being:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to modify themselves (under certain circumstances)</li>
<li>Procreation being difficult to impossible</li>
<li>Genetically modified and enhanced with technology and magics</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="songbirdbeingscreaturespseudoneosongbirdmd"><a href="....%5CBeings%5CCreatures%5CPseudoneo%5CSongbird.md">Songbird</a></h3>
<p>Primarily robotic creatures disguised in flesh and feathers, this species is designated towards all things related to aerial transport.
Taking the shape of common birds, these beings vary drastically in size, from a small finch to something capable of competing with young dragons.
Nowadays commonly tasked by mankind to carry goods and people alike.</p>
<h2 id="dwarvesgroupingsdwarvesmd"><a href="....%5CGroupings%5CDwarves.md">Dwarves</a></h2>
<p>Insect-like entities, created at the zenith of the Lavish Empire as subterran mining force, aimed at carving out the now-Hollow Mountains.
Built tough and resilient, they can withstand nearly all contemporary weaponry of impact.
This is due to their sought-after artisan skills, in which they perfected unique ways of working the metal they carve out of the mountains. In this process, they understood body armour in a very literal sense, augmenting their thick carapaces with even thicker plates of steel.</p>
<h3 id="symbioparasitebeingscreaturespseudoneosymbioparasitemd"><a href="....%5CBeings%5CCreatures%5CPseudoneo%5CSymbioparasite.md">Symbioparasite</a></h3>
<p>Amorphous organisms capable of entering and residing with another being, easily resembles amobae. Originally engineered as enhancement and supplement to sensory and cognitive capabilities, some of these have turned independent and became rabid killers, taking over hosts and using them to spread themselves.
They are facing extinction, since the violent kind has caused significant hunts and orders of Kill On Sight, as the benevolent branch is too fragile to sustain itself out in the wild.</p>
