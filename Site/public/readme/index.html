<p>A slightly oversized and overdone Worldbuilding project, singlehanded-ly done by me.
Originally designed as D&amp;D(ish) + Home-brew setting, has expanded out and beyond that ever since.
There&rsquo;s little understandable or coherent, linked story going on, since my interests are more in the entire overarching environment and such. But you&rsquo;ll find some texts that are from the point of view of a individual, who might become a persistent character. Who knows.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
<a href="WIP%20or%20Projects%5CWorkpieces%5CTowards%20the%20Reader.md">Towards the Reader</a>.</p>
<h3 id="themes">Themes</h3>
<p>There’s no consistent theme aside from “the world is horrible yet we keep on pushing” and issues arising from that, so, have fun!
<strong>In terms of genres and bullet points this project includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Computer- and machine-centric fiction (Primarily in the Third Era)
<ul>
<li>Cyberpunk, related digital concepts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steampunk and derivatives seen in the worship of the Mechanical God
<ul>
<li>Somewhat own interpretation of steampunk and such
<ul>
<li>represented in Thylyist of the Second Era</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A mostly-fleshed out magic system</li>
<li>40-60%ish Mapped out continent with regional oddities and such
<ul>
<li>Read <a href="Overviews%5CSummaries%5CLocations%20and%20You.md">Locations and You</a> for such.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Themes of modifying life
<ul>
<li>Through Technology, = augmentation</li>
<li>Through Magic, = Sarkicism/Nolkan practices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not to forget, various dystopian/grim-dark views of the world</li>
<li><a href="Overviews%5CSummaries%5CUniversal%20Pantheon.md">Universal Pantheon</a> of Deities who rose after the <a href="Overviews%5CConcepts%5CTheophagy.md">Death of Divinity</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="starting-to-read">Starting To Read</h3>
<p>Start here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="Overviews%5CSummaries%5CFaction%20Overview.md">Faction Overview</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="Overviews%5CSummaries%5CThings%20that%20Need%20Fixing.md">Things that Need Fixing</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If careless about spoilers: <a href="Overviews%5CSummaries%5CMajor%20Plotlines.md">Major Plotlines</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the magic system, consider reading around <a href="Realms%5CPlanes%5CTwilit.md">Twilit</a> and <a href="Overviews%5CConcepts%5CMagic%20System%5CTwilit%20Casting.md">Twilit Casting</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lifeforms and species are described in <a href="Overviews%5CSummaries%5CSpecies%20of%20Servilia.md">Species of Servilia</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The files in the WIP or Projects/Workpieces directory are mostly texts sourced from sudden inspiration, and those are the most coherent in terms of action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="WIP%20or%20Projects%5CWorkpieces%5CRegarding%20the%20Planets%20and%20Star.md">Regarding the Planets and Star</a> explains the current state of the solar system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
<p>A coherent story/timeline is yet to come.
However, the History of Servilia (The name of this continent) can roughly be divided into &ldquo;The Past&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Present&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Future&rdquo;.
Read <a href="History%5CEras%5CThe%20First%20Era%5CThe%20First%20Era.md">The First Era</a>, <a href="History%5CEras%5CThe%20Second%20Era%5CThe%20Second%20Era.md">The Second Era</a> and <em>The Third Era</em> respectively.
They&rsquo;re also available at <a href="History%5CEras%5CHuman%20Eras.md">Human Eras</a> due to two or so other sentient species existing, but nothing from their point of view is documented (yet).</p>
<h3 id="misc">Misc</h3>
<p>So far, the #Overviews tag should be pretty self-explanatory and helpful.</p>
<p>For best reading experience, I highly advocate <a href="%5Bhttps://obsidian.md%5D(https://obsidian.md/)">Obsidian</a> as editor/reader, since it enables various widely-used features like file links, tags and alike.</p>
<p>Various other things exist here as well due to me using this as Notepad, but you&rsquo;re better off ignoring it.</p>
