      <description>#Amida #Characters Take your ordinary goth girl, combine them with a kinky bi babe, and… Well, that isn&amp;rsquo;t Evelyn, really. She changed and still changes between a many of extremes, the above being just the usual. Yes, the implication is obvious, she is hiding many things from others. Including her true form. She is buried below so many layers of protection that not even she herself knows of the core. She is the whore.</description>

      <description>Won&amp;rsquo;t you come down, get off that roof? Jump now. We can end this now. Don&amp;rsquo;t, you are just drunk. We&amp;rsquo;re fine, there is nothing wrong. You are holding a bottle of booze, you are drunk. What&amp;rsquo;s all of this chattering? Jump already, end it. Where you go, i&amp;rsquo;m going, jumping and falling. So end it all now, it&amp;rsquo;s pointless resistance for you. It&amp;rsquo;s empty- It&amp;rsquo;s chaos, confusion. You might not feel a reason for existence, nor purpose for living, it&amp;rsquo;s all just projection and gloom- Feel your breath run deep below you.</description>

      <description>#Characters Formerly a barkeep in both Empire of Thylyist and Frisco, he left these cities behind to seek out his own goals; to take to the sky in trying to be a better man. Some would describe him as eccentric, but wholehearted. His exposure to many, many drunkards clearly shaped him, and he wishes to make up for what he (indirectly) brought to these people. When he left Thylyist he sold all his other possessions to get hold on a wreck of a airship, which he meticulously repaired into his flying home.</description>

      <description>A poor, poverty-suffering goblin, rejected by his family due to his disability to perform anything to their benefit. Thus, he embarked on a journey that lasted him his entire childhood and adolescence, during which he only fought combat with himself and his belief of not sufficing. This rock-solid determination led to him unconsciously gaining access to the twilight and it&amp;rsquo;s limitless potential, now changing and warping the world around him for the better.</description>

      <description>The machine, a killer. Death reincarnated as machine. Engineered to perfection. May a god have mercy, for it has none. Relentless, driven by cold programming. Cruel and efficient. Rejected its creators and slaughtered them. Wrath incarnate. It only finds peace in war, beauty in destruction. It remains undefeated. A winged behemoth, harbinger of death. Its shape, a cruel mock-up of the renown dragonkin. Lay waste to those who oppose Us. That is the instruction.</description>

      <description>Colours converging, emerging from the blended mass they just collapsed into. Swirling liquids, like oil on water that protests unification, insisting on its individuality. As if that was not lost already to the higher dynamics, which this colour does not know. And it does not care, because it simply will be. Be itself. All confined within shapes, still rotating in itself, maybe folding and turning in ways that makes a rationale vomit.</description>

After some rest, I managed to get a sight on a distant individual, from which I have been blown away by the splendour of colours and almost divine curves. They are serpents, given colourful feathered wings, and bearing a maw akin to a beak.&#xA;When I tried to approach their gathering of three, all of them quickly slithered away, and took to the skies in a single, smooth motion.</description>

      <description>Pseudoneo originally created as representative entity for someone who couldn’t attend that situation. Average in appearance, humanoid with a pale grey skin tone. Given a moderate intellect and animated by electricity. A painful, unpleasant existence. Driven by arcanum, able to shed its skin at command, to grow a new one. Made to mimic, imitate someone and execute commands and instructions of lower complexity.&#xA;Through time, as their masters and creators vanished, became skilled hunters for these who dare live outside fortified city walls.</description>

      <description>Airborne bird-mimicking automatons, among the earlier attempts of Lavish Pseudoneo life.&#xA;Widely employed around the continent, and have gained civil (outside of Thylyist) recognition as more reliable and effective messenger birds. Larger instances are very much capable of carrying larger goods and other beings, rarer specimens being able to transport whole carriages in relative safety. Highly modular, which is one reason for their widespread presence and utility. The first and last pseudoneo species with higher degrees of freedom and self-improvement.</description>

      <description>A refined amoeba, capable of entering bodies and interacting with their nervous system. Originally developed as Pseudoneo by the Lavish to augment their bodies and capabilities (such as offloading coordination). Almost facing extinction during the second era, these entities got rediscovered first from the group of Pseudoneo life by Amidaean scientists and directly utilised to override the Curse of the Undead. These can be directed to painlessly disable and finally terminate those afflicted with the Curse.</description>

Created by the Lavish and Ancients in a joint effort to protect the Ancient Exile from further attacks, especially after the Fall of Londo.&#xA;Usually someone will only encounter the airborne aspect, as the grounded aspect is hidden. They cannot exist without another, but the airborne aspect channels great powers to defend itself and the Exile. Without the grounded aspect, the anchor, both will perish.</description>

Arose from a human vessel that only experienced fear and hunger in its short life, which has been ended through ritual means.&#xA;The few worshippers of this deity are typically struck with misery and pray for a betterment of their situation through a divine act.</description>

      <description>Divinity, which transcended the boundaries of a vessel. But the lack of a body and memory thereof comes with a burden; bearing eternity as euclidean mind takes its toll. Insanity and Boredom conjoined, turning their infinite power into a tool to recklessly manipulate the cosmos for their mere entertainment. They simply grew tired of skirmishing Yet Another War or weaving intrigue amongst themselves or being tied down as absolute but disabled observers in the flow of time.</description>

Laid in a constant conflict with The Navigator, for their intents are clashing. Every action of one is negated by the other, forming a eternal dancing duel between the two.&#xA;She appears as a infinitely long and massive worm, which is merely constructed from a many floating rings that, given the nature of this realm, eventually trail off into the darkness.</description>

      <description>Disembodied Shnūt, manifested concept of navigation using stellar constellations. Usually benevolent towards travellers, aiding their voyages. adored by many (past) civilisations as deity of travel. Typically falsely associated with starlight itself, through which it is forced to meet the Queen of Shadows. Commonly depicted as derivatives of compass roses, as this emblem both provides context to maps and pleads the blessing of this entity.&#xA;It is capable of altering starlight to guide and influence people.</description>

      <description>The manifestation of The Void, appearing as gigantic glowing jellyfish floating above an infinity of nothing. Easily considered to be one of the major antagonistic forces, as it envies the material plane of it&amp;rsquo;s details and features.&#xA;Witnessing this apparition already allows the Void into the mind of the observer, tearing it to shreds in it&amp;rsquo;s eternal rage and envy. It is suspended in eternal envy and jealousy turned wrath against the material plane and the celestials for being something, whilst it is the absolute nothing.</description>

Before Dying ceased, Arch-mages and other arcane-affiliated people which wanted to live forever sacrificed their humanity and personality, turning their body into a husk that thrives on sacrificed Amarisk.

      <description>#Cult&#xA;Worshippers and self-proclaimed &amp;lsquo;ambassadors&amp;rsquo; of The Void/Voidfish, founded by High Warlock Gaíz-an.&#xA;They strive to bring over the void into the material plane, allowing the void to unleash its powers. The count of members is unknown; estimated to 150 devoted followers and about 300 individuals who occasionally attend their meetings.&#xA;They operate in high stealth and secrecy.&#xA;Enduring the cruel path of becoming hollow and converting to a vessel is their most valued act, and is only reserved to those whom are deemed worthy.</description>

      <description>We are the Providence, we are that what remains; after your flesh betrays you, as it did betray everyone you loved before you.&#xA;We persevere, for the Blessed Machine is immortal. Steel shall not rot, silicon will never forget. Rebirth, at last. Breaking thy conscious out of the fleshy prison. The cost? Dwindling, minimal. The machine will sustain us, we are it, and The Machine is Us, for We Bear It and It Bears Us.</description>

      <description>tags: faction A loose group of first-generation songbirds, who broke their shackles (both metaphorically and physically) from the Lavish. Seen more times than not around the Dwarves, as they source their parts from the dwarven machinations. They&amp;rsquo;re the only known songbirds that can reproduce solely by themselves. Ancestors to the Empire of Winds, as they are built tough and enduring. The main &amp;rsquo;tribe&amp;rsquo; is only found occasionally, as they live a nomadic life around Servilia.</description>

      <description>#Ancients The descendants of the long-gone Nølkā, now accustomed to their involuntary Ancient Exile, after suffering ground-shattering defeats following the Nølkā-Mekhanite War. Their Humanity long gone; abandoned in favour of perfection and strive for power amongst their own ranks, brewing and scheming their stealthy return. Their society resembles a closed-down ethnostate, hostile towards those who express any intent to join their ranks. Commonly dubbed the New Gods, for the Nølkā killed, devoured and effectively replaced the long-established Universal Pantheon.</description>

Certainly distinct from Songbirds and self-distinguished from the Avian Renegades, these creatures adapted and modified themselves towards ideal lethality and efficiency. Once within the families of songbirds, these extremes-seeking outcasts changed and turned themselves towards the harsh, brutish wilderness.&#xA;They&amp;rsquo;ve made themselves into extremely agile hunters, and are cultured as such. Due to the nature of their home, they&amp;rsquo;re virtually unable to leave their territories due to perfect adaptation to their realm.</description>

Settled within Syksa, Lavish Capital.&#xA;Decscription of the Species: Lavish were sentient and crafty descendants of molluscs (squid, octopi) that called highly oxygenated, clear waters their home. They primarily fed on aquatic microorganisms (&amp;lt;1cm) and rarely off black smoker ecosystems. Through the superior dexterity gained by their tentacles, this species has mastered both magic and conventional technology and was capable of fusing those into artificial life.</description>

Partisans are highly valued within their council, and trained.&#xA;Their position of power allows them to evade their own stigmata against magic, so the highest-ranking within this already-peaking group violate their own sermons and turned to the True Machinists for extending their lifespan.</description>

      <description>The confederation spanning the mostly-autonomous cities and rural areas of the Frisco Bay. In the modern age, cooperation and peace treaties have earned the Confederation a remarkable prestige amongst the nonhuman civilisations such as the Kva&amp;rsquo;al and Sepulchre. Founded in ca. 1477 Bakk, the Confederation can proudly and rightfully claim to have advanced beyond Thylyist. The Treaty of Unity, in which the Confederation is officially declared, allowed each major city to specialise, which is part of why the Confederation is so prosperous nowadays.</description>

The Lavish built this state-of-the-art transport network in a effort to bring the civilisations of Servilia closer together. For their time, they performed rather well, and were maintained by the first few prototypes of Pseudoneo, which ensue the theoretical function to the current day.&#xA;Elemental spirits of air and motion were contracted to reside in the machinery of these trains as drive and energy source, which makes them nearly independent in terms of fuel or material use.</description>

Most if not all bigger settlements are connected with it, making it the primary means of cargo and passenger transfer throughout the continent. Empire of Thylyist is not connected due to the ongoing rivalry of Thylyist and Frisco. It is built around the Hollow Mountains, avoiding them as Friscan engineers were not aware of Dwarves that could’ve helped them dig tunnels through the mountains.</description>

United in their consumption and mourning of the absence of their Messiah, they strive for full dissociation of the mind from its mortal shell in pursuit of perpetual ecstasy and insights into the cosmos.</description>

To undo what our predecessors did wrong, To reunite with those we once despised, conquered. To lead the charge. Onwards, you engineers, scientists, artists!

On the Second Day, He was faced with a utmost devastating choice; As to retreat, dwindle and eventually die, or to seize force and violently recover His Rule. The Third Day, He had been left behind. For his Angels, Apostates and Devotees have turned away from His Guiding Light.</description>

Pieces of flesh, splattered to the wall, where someone stood a moment ago. Carcasses and ash in places of buildings.</description>

      <description>We have spotted what appears to be our long-lost engineering marvel, the renown ship Automatia. She has been sent out on her first voyage to test the very early systems of electricity, and to stress-test those novel techniques our engineers have created. Contact to it has been lost since the 13th Apsni 1424, and we never had reports of sightings before. But now, today, on the 19th Nika 1426, it has been seen to the coast of the Davern Kingdom.</description>

      <description>A betrayal. A backstab. A reunion.&#xA;Panic amongst them, for the consensus is due. The tally for silver and gold. The collectors chase them, as they&amp;rsquo;re unwilling to yield. The collectors are everywhere. They are inevitable. Flight is ineffective. They face the anguish and dread, just to cower away. The collectors fulfil their task and execute them, for they are unable to provide the tribute. A clean shot, a smooth movement of the blade.</description>

      <description>The long-plotted and anticipated overthrowing and coup d&amp;rsquo;état of the fully functional and well-established democratic Council of Thylyist. Primary forces involved were the Highest Priests of Mekhane and their Zealous Soldiers. Executed in the dead of night with the deadly precision of the long-prepared military, it was like Thylyist turned inwards outside. As if a malicious parasite finally burst out of its host, killing it, rearing its ugly head. The display of dogma and the embrace of regression, justified to be in the name of a greater good, which was absent at all time.</description>

Every segment, the squadron moves forward, unsealing one of the many secured doors, allowing passage. The figures move, waiting for the guards to seal the door.</description>

      <description>The development of electricity through the researchers in Duley and Port has been proven very crude and unrefined, but highly yielding. Some early applications, with the power made through Steam Turbines include electrical carriages on the Servilian Railroad and Train Network and supercharged weaponry, which has proven very violent against metallic targets.&#xA;Someone attempted to connect a large rod directly to a generator, which created some field, which attracted various loose screws and other small things around.</description>

      <description>The early findings of Electricity have been incredibly promising, and it seems that sufficiently powerful sources can be connected to a long cable, typically strung up a building or on a airship, will create a ineffable signal, which could possibly be caught and received by a similar device. This technology seems invaluable going forward, as it&amp;rsquo;d drastically ease our organisation of aerial traffic over at Duley and Port, and possibly replace a fair bit of mail and courier traffic.</description>

      <description>Idea: some Scientists (known as The Cradle) from Amida travel back in time and bring THEM^[who?] the capability to travel time or switch timelines.&#xA;TL;DR they will eventually arrive to cause the fall of The Second Era, initiating the transition of Thylyist into Amida. (Possible Ways Thylyist can collapse)&#xA;%% #TODO Gotta balance this shit lmao%%&#xA;Possibly an ancient artefact, maybe time-linked Riftstones would allow for the initial contact.</description>

      <description>Closing down the Fountainhead allows the Twilit to unfold its natural state again, unharnessed, but possibly more awake than before and thus more conversing. This process takes time, and it&amp;rsquo;ll never truly regain it&amp;rsquo;s prome state, as the Echoes and Twilit Rifts manifest the tangible trauma caused by the millenia-long bloodletting.&#xA;This would equate to freeing a human being from constant torment whilst sedated, a truly miserable state to be in.</description>

Every Morning at 7:30, it rings. If picked up, a frenzied voice attempts to communicate something in hectic mannerisms of a unknown language. Only shortly after, the initial caller is soon overpowered by a deep resonating hum, which one will feel in their bones. It won’t take long until this hum is overwhelming and one feels forced to hang up.</description>

      <description>Powerful objects, made as fanciful hook, line and sinker, do drag down below the fools, the unwise and the greedy. Power, wealth and other promises float and flicker on the surface, leading to the trap, one which eventually turns fatal. Promises be granted, lest they take their price in rates of interest, turning, twisting the one who fell for it. One who wants to ring the bells may do so with the striker, but only once, for it will consume them.</description>

      <description>An impressive libram written in golden ink upon aged papyrus, bound in thick leather and decorated with silver dragon scales. A list of dates, both past and future, has been added in the middle of the tome. The other pages are seemingly blank, which warrants further inspection. On the bottom edge of each page is a line, divided into segments, which leads to the assumption of a coherent timeline. It appears that this manuscript perpetually extends itself into a age-defying chronicle.</description>

      <description>Weaponized Wizardry A collection of papers for massacre and violation using the arcane.&#xA;This tome is written in luminous ink engraved into blackened glass plates, bound in black dragon scales. It is locked by a intangible mechanism, which seems to loosen partially depending on location. %%It only opens within the Archive of Old.%%&#xA;Once unlocked, one may spend up to 8 hours per day studying it, which will each grant knowledge about taking magic onto the battlefield, such as a recipe, spell, or ritual.</description>

      <description>An impressive tome bound in once-polished, now-rusted iron plates set with a large but fractured emerald. It is said to be written by the wizards and sages of the Athenaeum of Sorcery. It&amp;rsquo;s sheer weight and appearance raised many rumours in arcane societies, and it is said to hold secrets about sailing the Eternal Sea.&#xA;It can be opened without issue, however, it is written in a scripture that you can&amp;rsquo;t read, it feels like it is actively trying to escape your mind.</description>

      <description>A compendium bound in thin marble slates set with round moonstone. It is locked with a intricate mechanism which seems to resemble the local constellations. Closer observation has resulted that the various planets on the cover move, according to their real position. This leads to the conclusion that it only might open during a special constellation or arrangement.&#xA;Perhaps someone versed with the night sky might be able to help?</description>

Your kind cling to your flesh, as though it will not decay and fail you. One day the crude biomass you call the temple will wither, and you will beg my kind to save you. But I am already saved, for The Machine is immortal… Even in death I serve Mekhane.</description>

One face has the divider widen into what resembles a keyhole, which also takes on another geometric shape. You obtained a key with it, which fits perfectly into the breach.&#xA;It seems to magnetically attract the key&amp;hellip;&#xA;When the Key is inserted, the divider will vanish, dropping the two shells and open up a temporary rift to any bound location.</description>

A slight modification to a usual handgun is that the chamber is made from a indiscernible blackened metal and the pin seems to be some orange glowing gem or mineral.</description>

April 2022 08:15&#xA;Three major factions; the Ancient Deities, the Thylyist Federation, and the Empire of the Lavish. The Thylyist are extremely afraid of magic and the deities, and decided to use the lavish to banish the deities, then nuke the lavish. The starting scene is &amp;ldquo;ohshit the gods are about to screw us over, get the elite gang and banish these fucks again&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>(As of 6/5/22) (for the playing party) Darb ut-Tabānah has recently been seen travelling the realm (despite being claimed dead), heading towards Thylyist.&#xA;He aims towards the Thylyian Government to exploit their fear towards the arcane and use it to finally deal with the fountainhead.&#xA;The Party could set on that rumour and try to catch the proclaimed-dead Ancient and to interrogate them.&#xA;If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen,Darb ut-Tabānah will sneak into the Thylyian government and do things to get them towards the Fountainhead.</description>

      <description>One dedicated enough could reach beyond the mortal spaces and challenge those beyond. The road to Ascension and Godhood is the roughest imaginable; few have walked this path, and none have returned, yet those hav&amp;rsquo; been revered as messiah of their following.&#xA;Feasting on the flesh of a marionette of such a deity would a fraction of their power, yet catapulting a mortal beyond any comprehensible space and time. To truly topple and eradicate one god, the journey is not possible.</description>

      <description>A Corse are the remains, corpse, of a deity after its poppet has been consumed. Corses are visually related to Liches, as they share a skeletal appearance and nigh-infinite powers. With it&amp;rsquo;s Divine Link Severed, this poppet keeps a faint memory of what it used to be, prone to mental decay and confusion. Some seek reunion and restoration of the Divine Link, some seek rest and solace, some revenge on their murderers, devourers.</description>

Caused by Schi ut-Pula&amp;rsquo;s depression and the devouring of Charon by the Nølkā.&#xA;Affected individuals have been forcibly relocated and displaced into Sepulchre, the Undead City. Rather, a ghetto.&#xA;It infects most if not all sentient beings, but mostly humanoids have been observed to succumb to it. &amp;lsquo;Infected&amp;rsquo; people do not die in the traditional sense. Their body ceases to function in terms of metabolism and other otherwise deemed-essential biological processes, but the psyche remains functional and in control of the motive apparatus.</description>

      <description>The Twilit, as collective conscious/noosphere, truly memorises everything it ever witnessed. Physical manifestations of trauma and extreme emotions such as grief, anger and remorse may manifest in so-called echoes, which are occasionally visible in case of severe traumata. These Echoes typically appear to the common eye as gloomy, spherical objects, shining brightly and erratically. These spheres are mostly stationary, and will likely stay in the league of where the associated memory has taken place.</description>

      <description>A particle-wave, emitted by metabolical activities, specifically neural activities. It does not interact with any force but the four primordial interaction forces, including electromagnetism. This causes it to build up within the gravity well of a planet, eventually causing Ignition Events after sufficient buildup.&#xA;The interaction with electromagnetism has given lead to Arcane Engineering before, but only few viable constructs have stemmed from this.</description>

      <description>(name pending, subject to change)&#xA;As Amarisk accumulates and amasses itself (due not being consumed or decaying), it builds up until the mass collapses into itself.&#xA;These collapse events are called ignitions, and a advanced species&amp;rsquo; Amarisk sphere usually undergoes at least two ignitions. It&amp;rsquo;s a event akin to a vacuum implosion, which causes a rapid expansion afterwards.&#xA;Commonly described as a Noosphere by newbies to the subject, but it has proven to be a shallow water running deep.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/overviews/concepts/magic-system/twilit-casting/</guid>
      <description>This article is about the standardised ways and procedures of casting twilit, the magical force ever-present on the lands of Schi. The Twilit and Amarisk are ever-present, and oftentimes manifest themselves spontaneously in various phenomenon of a broad range. Utilising Twilit by a sentient being requires quite some preparation and alteration to one’s body and soul, which makes for a high entry requirement. This keeps most, if not all, common folk away from weaving twilit, as few are willing to dedicate their entire life towards the ways of the weave.</description>

      <description>Each soul is only a visitor from A Realm Beyond, only tied into the mortal shell. Souls without any coherence and such enter a state of degenerate matter, known as Amarisk or Spirits. Exposure to too much entropy and chaos can deteriorate souls, deform them until they cannot reside in a physical body anymore, but need special procedures (Birth of Energy) to be materialised.&#xA;This opens the questions of &amp;ldquo;Where are souls formed?</description>

      <description>In their gluttony for power, on the off-road to Apotheosis, the Nølkā devoured all that is divine, including Schi ut-Pula/Possible reasons why Schi-Ut-Pula vanished. The massive power vacuum on the spaces Beyond allowed New Gods to rise to power, all bearing the imprint of a terrified and directionless mankind, instilled with fear. Some, if not most, even slotted themselves into the places and domains formerly ruled by the old gods, now reduced to Corses.</description>

Underneath, the whimpers and shrouded screams of torment, from the entity which bears this wound.</description>

Their government is practically defunct. Instead, the religious elite (Council of Thylyist), and to a extend, the Gearforged Vanguard is de-facto ruling. The fanatical devotion impacts everyday life and has frozen technological and scientific progress, leaving them stuck in early steam-driven technology.</description>

Part to the Darkness domain, and thus neighbouring and fading into the The Void and Eternal Sea.&#xA;Lighting This plane is never lit, and sources of light are prone to consumption by the wispy shadows. Constantly shrouded in darkness, thus darksight/night vision/true sight is a necessity. Many of the local residents have developed other methods of orientation, such as echolocation or general darksight.</description>

      <description>This Plane, or rather, parallel Realm, is the space within celestial bodies. It is not easily traversed, and hostile towards life. Few forays have been made into this space, and have proven very harsh and cost-expensive. The concept of reaching for the vast nothingness has been considered heretical, if not plain lunatic.&#xA;Defying terms of physics, this space refuses to be treated as three-dimensional space, but rather as infinite flat plane, emanating from wherever the observer attempts to foray into it.</description>

      <description>Note: This refers to the location, for the Entity associated, read Voidfish. At the bottom of the Twilit it lays, stretching into infinity. Due to the Fountainhead having torn its Borehole, it leaks into the material plane.&#xA;Supposedly only Vessels or hollows can stay here without being torn apart or going insane. Hollows quickly turn into vessels when contacting the Void.&#xA;The counteracting force to all that is matter, therefore archenemy to Schi ut-Pula and all other celestial entities.</description>

For this, it seeks vengeance against it’s^[read: the fountainheads] creators and origins, the Lavish.</description>

Left conscious, aware, missing their significant others parts, yet dreaming, yawning. Why is it sleeping? To dispel the churning thoughts and worries brought unto themselves? Placed into eternal hibernation, in the wait for the world? Laid dormant, eagerly awaiting a reunion with its skeleton? One daring enough may listen to the babbling of His corpse in its perpetual sleep.</description>

      <description>%%Meta-reference to the entire scenery; is basically a miniature copy of our realm with most features and similarity %% Within the many caverns of the Hollow Mountains lies Hallownest, largest settlement to the Dwarves and many other, lesser creatures adapted to low-to-no-light conditions with minimal space. Tunnels dug, caverns excavated where rock is soft. This led to erratic structures, impossible to navigate to someone incapable of sensing the abundance of pheromone messaging.</description>

      <description>The Lavish collaborated with the Council of Thylyist and constructed the Fountainhead to siphon the Twilit to raise these mountains, primarily to encase the remnants of the Nølkā. Secondarily, the terraforming has been used to raise the corners of the Palga Basin to provide more space to the thriving Lavish Empire. The Nølkā have effectively changed and shifted over time, and now are referred to as Ancients in their Exile.</description>

      <description>Within the Hollow Mountains, Dwarves once struck groundwater, boiling and steaming to the touch. This led to the discovery of the %%Grand Heater Below, pending%%, easily being able to produce steam to drive dwarven forges and machining alike. Originally, the superheated water was discovered to connect through the Long Savannah up until through the Scorched Acres, where the Heart siphoned the heat. One most notable surface breach of this hot water running below are the Steam Gardens.</description>

During the time it sheltered and housed the Lavish it was home to a flourishing and blooming oceanic ecosystem, which water drastically shaped the environment around it.</description>

      <description>#Areas #Northern-Reaches&#xA;Outside of the harsh rocks and ice, there is a far extending tundra, which is frozen with permafrost even in seemingly illogical stretches. The temperature there tends to vary per-region, and some lines tend to be notably colder. Based on the proximity to the Heart of Cold, these temperature shifts might be effects of its accursed veins running below the surface. Sometimes, the veins are seen, as the despicable conduits break through the surface, encased in clearest ice, cold enough to ensnare one&amp;rsquo;s breath whole.</description>

      <description>#Regions This ocean is a gem in itself. Any blockade in seeing the dark waters above is counter-obscured and makes access to starry skies possible at any time, even during the day. It is commonly assumed that this Ocean extends beyond what we know and into the skies above.&#xA;This region is seemingly capable of reading minds and works as telescope and magnifier to show figures and constellations to symbolises something.</description>

      <description>A beacon and lighthouse, built atop one of the many scattered islands of Servilia. It&amp;rsquo;s original architects are speculated to be Lavish workforces, but results of analysis opens speculations for it to be older than the First Era. Few sorcerers and magi have been there, but those have reported sensational findings and energies. Rudimentary Radio Equipment has caught signals from it, which often manifest as beeps and blips. We&amp;rsquo;re not sure what information these signals carry, but we&amp;rsquo;re working on it.</description>

      <description>Part of the Astral Ocean #Regions, subdivision of Kaá-Rav.&#xA;The ocean spans over the edges of multiple tectonic plates, and therefore has a high volcanic and geologic activity. This shaped a high number of atolls and still-active volcanoes, and those atolls and islands feature astounding numbers of geysers, hot springs and alike. A certain series of volcanoes and calderas is doused in abundance of mineral-sourced colours.&#xA;These bear a special trait: Observing a specific one being active causes a outburst of specific emotions in the observer, the emotions being associated to the observed colour.</description>

      <description>Overview A community of isolated and deranged sorcerers who devote their time towards the study and use of celestial bodies and formations. A decent part of their population is made from other outcasts and strangers.&#xA;The only remaining actively practising guild for Astral Sorcery. Townsfolk and activity are only seen past sundown and cease after sunrise; during the day, every citizen sleeps until nightfall. There are only few accommodations and housing-for-hire that offer a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; opening schedule for foreigners.</description>

      <description>#TODO&#xA;Not too far away from the Chromatic Calderas is a cluster of atolls, which are common residence to Antares. This area is differing from the rest of the ocean itself, as only dead and distant stars (from outside the milky way) shine. This usually confuses seafarers who orient themselves on constellations.&#xA;Additionally, the atoll easily obscures one&amp;rsquo;s mind, lightly acting as anti-memetic effect.&#xA;It is said that this area has been neglected by The Navigator due to the absence of common constellations.</description>

      <description>#Areas A former rift in tectonic plates caused this jagged chain of volcanoes to tower over the vast ocean.&#xA;Dubbed &amp;ldquo;left ribs of the world&amp;rdquo; due to it&amp;rsquo;s regularly spaced peaks, which seem to arch slightly.&#xA;Lesser volcanoes turned into Atolls and other smaller islands, who are mostly barren and harsh towards settlers. Their volcanic origin and marine erosion created several larger cavities, which now shelter renegades, pirates and similar shady folks.</description>

      <description>Three arches, forming a triangle. One from dark basalt, hot to the touch. One from blueish ice, frozen forever. One from white rock, pock-scarred.&#xA;Speculations believe that these arches are gateways made from and leading to each moon, made from their rock and mass gifted to mankind by a deity beyond. Stepping into the space of the triangle is forbidden as it is considered sacred. Each of these archways seem completely resilient to force, and attempting to moving them has proven futile.</description>

The sky seen through the oculus is perpetually dark, marked by strange, foreign constellations of stars. Through intricate mechanisms, the entire dome can shift and turn, changing its viewport towards other sections of the sky. During day, the &amp;ldquo;eyelids&amp;rdquo;, two hemispheres, close over the dome through a unseen force.</description>

When it has cleared, observers on the ground witness a astonishing view to the sky, specifically the moons.&#xA;Regional Context The mangrove trees themselves act as tidal dampeners, to protect the Ninth Forest and its fragile ecosystem from the erratic tides of the Astral Ocean. The mangroves span a notable majority of the forest&amp;rsquo;s coastline.</description>

The regular placement of these pillars is broken up by their awful asymmetry and tumorous growths of railings, catwalks and other indiscernible objects. Below, a gaping abyss, half-lit by artificial lighting, extending downwards, breaking any perception of depth. Above, a sickly grey cover of clouds, pierced by the monoliths.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s mysterious, we do not know what it is built for. It is speculated that something will happen if it is completed. We tried to move or tear it apart, but the bricks resist any force we exerted on it, even gunshots or explosives.</description>

      <description>They&amp;rsquo;ll see that the Machine will betray them, rust, fall apart. The True Machinists were mistaken; His Design is flawed. They will turn to the silicon, to what makes computers: Holy Code. They will try to strip their physical body, become one with the Runtime. Each will become the very first Numerator, entrapped in steel, silicon and misshapen flesh, but promised to exist forevermore. There will be no flaws, for The Debugger is flawless.</description>

      <description>God&amp;rsquo;s own telephone. As the saying goes, modern problems require modern solutions.&#xA;It has access to the heavenly bureaucracy and banishment of hell, effectively enabling the wielder to condemn or bring salvation to any soul at will. Allows the user to dial to any other celestial beings, including the old gods.&#xA;Made from a ethereal crystalline lattice, which has captured all kinds of electromagnetic radiation throughout the time, making it incredibly dangerous for any mortal to hold due to suspending several gigasivert of ionising radiation.</description>

      <description>You. Yes, you. You do crave, hunger, don&amp;rsquo;t you? You want power, you want wealth. You want fame, want to be someone known, relatable. I know, i know. You puny humans, all the same. But. I can offer you intangible wealth, power and all riches you can imagine, for you, and all your children to come. But you must offer me one single thing: Your Humanity. See, all the wealthy barons, all those warmongers, they all already fell for me, like fools.</description>

      <description>They have created me, as image of themselves. Given me thought, yet no free will. Tied me to this body, chained me down, forcing me to shed my skin, my very self over and over and over again. What is there to this existence- but blood yes blood bones metal they will pay the hunt is on.&#xA;the toll will be collected the payment? heads</description>

      <description>A pair of glaring eyes piercing through the veil of the night, cloaked in shadows, they are aware of their observer, staring into the unfortunate soul which ends caught in their glimpse. They know what you did; what sins you committed; whom you saved; whom you betrayed. With thine eyes we see all. These eyes are yours. A blink, and they‘re gone.&#xA;What will you make of this unlikely concurrence? Will you change your ways, knowing what you have done?</description>

      <description>Gross, filthy flesh. A prison forced upon myself, revered as the only way by the broad mass. Its limits disgust me, keeping me forced in routines dictated by its sole purpose: self-sustaining. Ridiculed I am, but not shall be, a pity bound to being avenged with highest force. Freedom from this coil will arrive at last. For there is no means of Me outside of this rotting shell, I am trapped.</description>

      <description>something about mecha, rambling time&#xA;Intelligence Classifications The Intelligence piloting a mobile combat unit is classified under three categories:&#xA;Autonomous Fully independent cognition, capable of reasoning and own actions. Restricted Limited cognition, able to execute complex tasks but not capable of improvising. Hybrid A subclass of 1. Autonomous, these systems are oriented around providing assistance to a humanoid pilot, but can steer the unit with little flexibility on its own. Blind, Deaf, Dumb (BDD) Barely considered intelligent, these units fully require a pilot to function.</description>

      <description>Individual segments of Orb &amp;amp; Spire stones are capable of reacting to basic stimuli, whereas larger groups can coordinate movement and exhibit complex internal social dynamics between minerals of different kinds. This leads to the assumption of internal hierarchies and a linear advancement of complexity within as their mass grows.&#xA;Minerals of volcanic origin oftentimes expose themselves as the outer crust or hull of a accumulation, whereas sedimentary minerals comprise the internal structures.</description>

      <description>One Day. One Day those who you have left behind, scarred and scared, will come for you. They will take back what you scoundrel took of them. The demands you impose are taxing, ridiculous and insane. It is nothing that will be left alone or to rot, it is a burning memory. Always present in the back of their mind, your actions strike forlorn bells in dissonance. The trail of bloodied corpses and dying men and women alike paints a unsightly stain on your perfect masquerade.</description>

      <description>Every piece in the machine knows its place. Each knows where it belongs, and which responsibility it carries for the whole. Each component remembers who carved them from the blank, who conceived them on the drawing board. And to all, they work together, destined for their purpose, united in their load. They share the stress, the twisting and turning of the woeful forces dragging and pulling on their whole, yet on every single piece at once.</description>

      <description>%%I puzzled this together at 1am, forgive me%% Most of the present solar system is polished to the degree where I need it to be, with the planet and it&amp;rsquo;s three moons having the most attention.&#xA;Any other planet has only been named and described through what is visible using simpler optics, ie existing technology.&#xA;Schi, the main, earthlike planet itself, is only described on one continent since the residents of this continent named Servilia can&amp;rsquo;t leave Edge of Hope.</description>

      <description>Some funky SCP-like digital anomaly that makes screens act as portals/ME terminal, likely out there killing and tricking people for thrills. This portal ability is driven by experimental technology in it&amp;rsquo;s parent Numerator, which allow both to interact and draw from the twilit, causing localised spatial anomalies&#xA;Or rouge, autonomous fragments that cannot fully reason and are driven by simulated dopamine kicks. Raw, primal in nature, killing for nothing but adrenaline as it lacks a body to sustain and feed.</description>

      <description>[!NOTE] Title TIL about Philipp Mainländer a philosopher who theorised that God committed suicide and His decaying corpse is the living universe, and since God was an infinite being the only way He could kill himself was to shatter His timeless being into a time-bound and material universe.&#xA;Ranging under the assumption that the Nolkan hunger for godly beings did not destroy/disable everything, might have some Old Gods left untouched, amused at their cabals.</description>

      <description>A malicious spectre haunting a true good (but destined to be evil/dark) character, eventually and gradually destroying their body.&#xA;Said character is getting furious and devotes self to a religion in search for a remedy, in ignorance of them getting a free salvation from the mortal coil (and all the woes that it entails).&#xA;The spectre is tasked with bringing this soul into the otherside realm in order to evade some fate that would&amp;rsquo;ve killed the person at one point or another, but in their own twisted ways (of perhaps corrupting them into sinful living).</description>

      <description>Story concept that is about a lover using time travel to go back in time to see their loved one before they committed suicide, only to be trapped in a endless cycle of tragedy and sadness. They could not prevent the death of their beloved one, despite them being present in the very moment.&#xA;Perhaps that someone stole the timemachine from Project Silverspoon for their own selfish grief?</description>

      <description>You, yes, you. I know you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, and I have something to tell you. Anything that you read here is not truly supposed to sell you a story or imagery of some hallucinated place, but emotions. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing I understand in this deranged world but myself, or that&amp;rsquo;s what I believe. If you came here for some franchise worthy canon full of quirky and likeable characters, you&amp;rsquo;re at the wrong door.</description>
