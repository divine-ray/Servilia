<p>I do not claim any listed works in <a href="Overviews%5CReferences.md">References</a> as my own nor do I (intend to) capitalise upon them, they only serve a role as inspiration.
Most of this project boils down as a amalgam and combination of many media influences, and purposes as a overarching canon to unify many works of art and other media.   ^f2df94</p>
<p>Many other inspirations and adaptations have been taken from other media, please refer to <a href="Overviews%5CReferences.md">References</a>.</p>
