<p>A large, locked coffer made from hardened steel, adorned with silver dragon scales.
It is filled to the brim with plain, leather-bound scriptures.
Each of these smaller books appears to be covered in a slight ethereal haze, which grows thicker if the books are moved haphazardly or read too quickly.</p>
<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>For a individual to be able to conduct and weave Twilit into elementary forces, one must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be capable of conducting Twilit through inputs and <a href="Spellcasting%20Glove.md">outlets</a>.</li>
<li>Conduct Twilit in a way that does not cause too much/too little resistance.
<ul>
<li>Having a too low resistance will conduct <em>too much</em> Twilit into the Woven, causing unforeseen spell reactions.</li>
<li>Having a too high resistance will cause the caster&rsquo;s body to physically heat up, damaging their body, possibly causing death.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have a good standing with the invoked spirit/force.</li>
</ul>
<p>To channel twilit and shape it into a Woven, the confined spell, one must provide means for the energies to flow through oneself, commonly directing the inflow through receptacle-like implants and allowing the outflow through a implement that can shape the energies into the Woven, typically a glove.
The receptacles currently employed are clunky, and are prone for causing unwanted attention.
A common design, which has proven efficient enough, is a implant mounted into the shoulder or neck which consists of stacked &ldquo;bowls&rdquo; or dishes in a supporting structure.</p>
