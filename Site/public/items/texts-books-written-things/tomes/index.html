It&rsquo;s contents are fabled to be arcane secrets of the arts of necromancy and voidweaving, banished and condemned into this hulk of a tome.
%%related to Tombstone and the old lich&rsquo;s grave within, as it is <em>the</em> necropolis%%</p>
<p>An impressive tome bound in once-polished, now-rusted iron plates set with a large but fractured emerald.
It is said to be written by the wizards and sages of the <em>Athenaeum of Sorcery</em>.
It&rsquo;s sheer weight and appearance raised many rumours in arcane societies, and it is said to hold secrets about sailing the <a href="....%5CRealms%5CPlanes%5CDark%20Domain%5CEternal%20Sea.md">Eternal Sea</a>.</p>
<p>It can be opened without issue, however, it is written in a scripture that you can&rsquo;t read, it feels like it is actively trying to escape your mind.
The general typesetting is chaotic as well, as some pages are written upside down or read right to left, and the index is at the middle of this scripture. You canâ€˜t seem to make sense of it, but presume that there is some higher logic behind it that escapes you.</p>
<p>Though, you can easily identify that it has a abundance of technical schematics and ritual circles written within. Some of these circles project themselves onto the floor through the emerald, however, they&rsquo;re massively flawed, probably due to the fractures.
Many of the technical diagrams seem to resemble <em>various naval vessels</em>, but with massively oversized sails of unknown fabric.</p>
<p>An impressive libram written in golden ink upon aged papyrus, bound in thick leather and decorated with silver dragon scales.
A list of dates, both <a href="Archive%20of%20Old.md">past and future</a>, has been added in the middle of the tome. The other pages are seemingly blank, which warrants further inspection. On the bottom edge of each page is a line, divided into segments, which leads to the assumption of a coherent timeline.
It appears that this manuscript perpetually extends itself into a age-defying chronicle.
However, you cannot make out the language of the scripture. You find it rather worrying that your entire life might be written in this book. The thought of having your entire family&rsquo;s history in here, by some unseen force, fills you with dread.</p>
<p>A compendium bound in thin marble slates set with round moonstone.
It is locked with a intricate mechanism which seems to resemble the local constellations. Closer observation has resulted that the various planets on the cover move, according to their real position. This leads to the conclusion that it only might open during a special constellation or arrangement.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone versed with the <a href="Lunatics.md">night sky</a> might be able to help?</p>
<h2 id="the-codex-of-telepathy">The Codex of Telepathy</h2>
<p>A collection of parchments contained in a cedar box inlaid with iron. It is said to have been stolen from the library of a forgotten god of secrets.</p>
<h2 id="sagonus-libram-of-the-lower-planes">Sagonus&rsquo; Libram of the Lower Planes</h2>
<p>A set of inscribed bones contained in a steel coffer set with deep green spinel. Many of its contents are marked with seemingly random numbers.</p>
<h2 id="the-libram-of-goblins">The Libram of Goblins</h2>
<p>a flawless compendium bound in rowan plates inlaid with electrum. It is said to be the key to seal the <em>Black Barrow of Ricusi the Eldritch</em>.</p>
<h2 id="-the-ways-of-using-amarisk">## The Ways of using Amarisk</h2>
<p>A large, locked coffer made from hardened steel, adorned with silver dragon scales.
It is filled to the brim with plain, leather-bound scriptures.
Each of these smaller books appears to be covered in a slight ethereal haze, which grows thicker if the books are moved haphazardly or read too quickly.</p>
<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>For a individual to be able to conduct and weave Twilit into elementary forces, one must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be capable of conducting Twilit through inputs and <a href="Spellcasting%20Glove.md">outlets</a>.</li>
<li>Conduct Twilit in a way that does not cause too much/too little resistance.
<ul>
<li>Having a too low resistance will conduct <em>too much</em> Twilit into the Woven, causing unforeseen spell reactions.</li>
<li>Having a too high resistance will cause the caster&rsquo;s body to physically heat up, damaging their body, possibly causing death.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have a good standing with the invoked spirit/force.</li>
</ul>
<p>To channel twilit and shape it into a Woven, the confined spell, one must provide means for the energies to flow through oneself, commonly directing the inflow through receptacle-like implants and allowing the outflow through a implement that can shape the energies into the Woven, typically a glove.
The receptacles currently employed are clunky, and are prone for causing unwanted attention.
A common design, which has proven efficient enough, is a implant mounted into the shoulder or neck which consists of stacked &ldquo;bowls&rdquo; or dishes in a supporting structure.</p>
<h2 id="book-of-cats-or-something">book of cats or something.</h2>
<p>mew.
got that feline energy and vibes, &ldquo;eats&rdquo; catnip^[secretly turns it into more paper] and is just overall goofy
WILL knock over any other books in it&rsquo;s presence, the competition is threatening!</p>
