It is said to be written by the wizards and sages of the <em>Athenaeum of Sorcery</em>.
It&rsquo;s sheer weight and appearance raised many rumours in arcane societies, and it is said to hold secrets about sailing the <a href="....%5CRealms%5CPlanes%5CDark%20Domain%5CEternal%20Sea.md">Eternal Sea</a>.</p>
<p>It can be opened without issue, however, it is written in a scripture that you can&rsquo;t read, it feels like it is actively trying to escape your mind.
The general typesetting is chaotic as well, as some pages are written upside down or read right to left, and the index is at the middle of this scripture. You canâ€˜t seem to make sense of it, but presume that there is some higher logic behind it that escapes you.</p>
<p>Though, you can easily identify that it has a abundance of technical schematics and ritual circles written within. Some of these circles project themselves onto the floor through the emerald, however, they&rsquo;re massively flawed, probably due to the fractures.
Many of the technical diagrams seem to resemble <em>various naval vessels</em>, but with massively oversized sails of unknown fabric.</p>
