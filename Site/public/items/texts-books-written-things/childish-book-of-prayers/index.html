<h6 id="preamble"><em>Preamble:</em></h6>
<p>That is our desire, our goal. Everyone, everything, consumed by the flame. Our history rests within fumes of smoke, but you are capable of dividing the fumes.</p>
<p>In the Beginning, there was nothing. A barren land, bearing the marks of a-many decayed and forgotten. Then, the Spark arrived. It lit up the lands, laying waste to those who opposed it. The cinders fell into the fertile seed, and rose. The roaring flames fell silent, as if they were to listen to the seed.
It grew.</p>
