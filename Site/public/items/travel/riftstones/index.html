A small stone, worked to resemble a regular geometric shape.
A glowing, fluctuating coloured line runs over the entire stone, dividing it in two halves. One face has the divider widen into what resembles a keyhole, which also takes on another geometric shape.
You obtained a key with it, which fits perfectly into the breach.</p>
<p>It seems to magnetically attract the key&hellip;</p>
<p>When the Key is inserted, the divider will vanish, dropping the two shells and open up a temporary rift to any bound location.
Basically acts as a way to quickly return to a place.
Deft application of these things drastically eases travel, as opening a rift at the target destination back allows for bidirectional traversal.<br>
