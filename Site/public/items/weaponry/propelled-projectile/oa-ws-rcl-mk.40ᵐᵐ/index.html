%%Varuú grenade launcher for stronger cyphers. Ranged Cypher Launcher %%
This peculiar piece of handheld weaponry features seven tubes on a rotary drum, each of which appear to be fitted silver, engraved with runes. Contrary to that, the entire frame except the grips (back and main trigger) appear as dull, greyish-black metal, which is cold to the touch.
The drum can be swayed to the side at the touch of a rune above its axle, presumably for loading the tubes.
A removable shoulder stock has been added above the trigger grip, which is held in place by several locked clasps.
A add-on rail spans the length from above the drum to almost the end of the muzzle. A ruined mount is fixed into place here, without any discernible function.</p>
<p>The pin appears to be a brightly-glowing orange-yellow crystal, which radiates a seemingly infinite warmth.</p>
<p>It appears that the chambers of the drum magnetically attract properly shaped potion vials and those <a href="..%5CCyphers.md">strange objects</a> you kept finding.
This weapon is apparently capable of directly firing spells from their material components without any previous preparations.</p>
<p>%%if the model 7 wasn&rsquo;t horrible and powerful enough, this bad bitch will throw arcane war crimes right into the face of the unfortunate guy on the other end of it%%</p>
