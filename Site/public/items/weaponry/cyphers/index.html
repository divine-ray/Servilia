Greater cyphers simply loose their power after activation, lesser cyphers shatter or disintegrate.
Superior cyphers may be used several times, but will discharge in a chain when force is acted upon it.
Greater cyphers may be &ldquo;recharged&rdquo; by re-applying their lost power/catalyst using a spell/ritual. Also applies for superior cyphers, as long as they remain intact.</p>
<h2 id="superior">Superior</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <em>smouldering</em>, raw shard of <em>bloody</em> ruby, with streaks of <em>glimmering embers</em> within it. Upon activation, it summons a fireball (6m sucessful dex save, 8d6 fire on fail, half on sucess) at either a desired or its own position (manual/thrown). It can cast up to eight fireballs before depletion.</li>
<li>A smooth and polished amber, containing a <em>tiny flame</em>.  Upon use, the amber turns ashen grey and a wall of inextinguishable flame emerges on the spot of activation, which can melt any metal.</li>
<li>A blueish-milky white icicle, with iridescent reflections playing on the surface.
Upon activation, it flash-freezes any substance until it&rsquo;s brittle in a radius of 3m. With each use, a centimetre of it melts away into common water, until the deep-frozen core at 15cm depletion remains (this equates to 5 uses).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="greater">Greater</h2>
<ul>
<li>A dragon&rsquo;s claw engraved with <em>glowing</em> symbols. When activated, the cypher grants the target advantage on attack rolls until the end of their next turn.</li>
<li>Grey Cypher:  A glass spindle filled with <em>silvery liquid</em>.  When broken over a weapon, the weapon is transmuted into a unknown metal.  It deals an additional 2d6 points of damage until the end of the session, after which the weapon disintegrates.</li>
<li>A jagged shard of emerald containing a <em>flickering flame</em>. When impaled into flesh, the cypher melts into eternal fire that lasts for a day.</li>
<li>A <em>broken</em> jade cube <em>warped by magic</em>. When thrown at a target, the cypher causes a small earthquake (knocked prone, Dex save negates).</li>
<li>A copper fragment smeared with <em>crimson blood</em>. When launched at a target, the cypher explodes with a thunderous bang (3d6 thunder damage and deafened, Con save half and negates).</li>
<li>A broken oaken staff <em>engraved with geometric patterns</em>. When held and activated, the cypher conjures a permanent wall of stone.</li>
<li>Crystal Fragment:  A large fragment of an obsidian sphere, containing a <em>shifting cloud of light</em>.  When held and activated, the cypher allows you to scry an individual creature known by name. However, you can only see their face.</li>
<li>A hydra&rsquo;s tooth engraved with <em>glowing symbols</em>. When activated, the cypher pushes all adjacent creatures fifteen metres away from the point of activation.</li>
<li>Cypher of the Iron King:  A jagged iron spike, <em>smeared with blood</em>. When impaled into the flesh of another creature, that creature becomes your thrall, as per the spell dominate person.</li>
<li>A moonstone fragment <em>warped by magic</em>. When thrown at a target, the cypher explodes into a cloud of noxious gas (3d6 poison damage and poisoned, Con save half and negates).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lesser">Lesser</h2>
<ul>
<li>A slender spindle of topaz containing a <em>mote of darkness</em>. When impaled into flesh, the cypher dissolves and causes localised acid burns, dealing 1d6 damage over 1d4 rounds.</li>
<li>A jagged shard of sapphire smeared with <em>black ichor</em>. When held and activated, <del>the cypher conjures a stone tower.</del></li>
<li>A platinum shard on a leather cord. When thrown at a target, the cypher destroys metal objects.</li>
<li>A jagged shard of sapphire on a chain of dark scales. When activated, the cypher conjures a creature of living shadow for 2d6 rounds.</li>

<li>A jagged shard of gray crystal smeared with crimson blood. When thrown, the cypher animates the struck object for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>A broken iron rod damaged by flame. When thrown at a target, the cypher explodes into a cloud of concealing smoke (disadvantages against any rolls by 3d4 per throw, lasts 2d6 rounds).</li>
<li>A malachite shard etched by acid. When thrown at a target, the cypher polymorphs it into a mouse, con save negates.</li>
<li>A Bamboo pipe, buzzing with wasps. When thrown, it bursts into a swarm of wasps.</li>
<li>A broken moonstone idol engraved with geometric patterns. When thrown at a target, the cypher conjures an area of invisibility.</li>
