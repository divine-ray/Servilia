It was created by the Thylyian Department of Construction. It is forged from beryllium bronze and HSLA steel, and it incorporates gears and other mechanical parts. Its powers are extremely predictable and reliable (often not requiring a roll for abilities that normally do), and might relate to constructs or creating order.">
