These Boots have been crafted by the <a href="....%5CGroupings%5CFactions%5CAncients.md">Ancients</a> in attempts to stride upon <a href="....%5CRealms%5CPlanes%5CDark%20Domain%5CThe%20Void.md">The Void</a>.
They appear as shimmering black leather boots that has been charred and turned pitch black at some parts.
The sole seems to be a unidentified durable rubber or similar flexible material. The cap of each boot is reinforced with a rounded metal cap, although it&rsquo;s not clear if this is steel or <a href="..%5CComponents,%20Ingredients%5CInanistathine.md">something else</a>.
This metal seems to pounce at bright light, and intensify shadows.</p>
<p>They seem very rugged yet durable.
Although the wearer may die, the Void will always retch them out.</p>
<p>Major property: <strong>Shifting</strong>
These boots allow the wearer to partially transcend above realms to stride in the void.
Additionally, these boots will mould and shape themselves to fit upon the wearer.
Â 
<em>Effect: whilst wearing, any individual not aligned with the Void may &ldquo;safely&rdquo; trespass it.</em>
(They&rsquo;re still exposed to the void and it&rsquo;s corrupting influence.)</p>
<p>Weight: light</p>
<p>Size: Small</p>
