<p>Through The Pierce, the Lavish ascended to a power level that threatened the Ancient Deities, who are big fans of harmony and they massively hated the Lavish for harming their (sentient, after all) power source</p>
<p>And somewhere in the cataclysm that&rsquo;s euphemised as &ldquo;Brotherhood Backstab&rdquo; the Catalyst got lost and the Fountainhead lost its harnessing power, creating a source of Chaos and Twilight&rsquo;s Wrath at the center of the Lavish</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This might be some of the Chtulu fuckers, &ldquo;Gedankenschinder&rdquo;</p>
<p>TL;DR the lavish were aquatic beings, residing in a massive lake/semi ocean</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also the lavish were so keen to merge magic and technology into feats which now are high traded artefacts and powerful gear</p>
