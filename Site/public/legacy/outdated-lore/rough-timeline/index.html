<p>People did decide against electricity and semiconductors as technology and got into steam and biotechnology.</p>

<p>The lavish people were actually just finished with their part of The Ancient Happening and they get fucking magic-nuked by their &ldquo;allies&rdquo;</p>
<p>-&gt; Brotherhood Backstab (1971)</p>
<p>And yea the ancient deities are on the rise again because the fountainhead is broken, which usually held them in containment</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s broken but its now on the brink of collapse and all fucky things come over through it</p>
<p>The current scene is &ldquo;ohshit the gods are about to screw us over, get the elite gang and banish these fucks again&rdquo;</p>
<p>The date of THEM (our gang) is somewhere in 2030&rsquo;s</p>
