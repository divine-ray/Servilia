      It was slaughter day. A year has since passed, and it was time for these cows to meet the knife. The priest was here, and he has given his ointments. They could see what was coming for them, but the atmosphere and blessing calmed them. The butcher uncoiled his rope, and started to tie them down, one by one. It was not for long, until all cattle were restrained but suspended in a haze from the incense in their pens on the marketplace.

Restructuring regarding the two heart cults/religions; Ghiaccia Conclave/Children of The Flame Assuming they’re each not trying to kill everyone or bring into the influence of their respective heart, They might just be trying to do something that aids the world, probably related to the Curse of Undying because both cold and flame can revert/stall the decay of the body and or allow the soul to escape.
Cult/New Religious Following Criteria Charismatic leader figure, for the hearts: possibly someone directly tied into the organism closely knit societal structure with odd/unique sets of norms and standards offering of some kind, a promise to potential new followers for the hearts: sharing part of the conscious into the organism’s neural system?

Each will become the very first Numerator, entrapped in steel, silicon and misshapen flesh, but promised to exist forevermore. There will be no flaws, for The Debugger is flawless.

It has access to the heavenly bureaucracy and banishment of hell, effectively enabling the wielder to condemn or bring salvation to any soul at will. Allows the user to dial to any other celestial beings, including the old gods.
Made from a ethereal crystalline lattice, which has captured all kinds of electromagnetic radiation throughout the time, making it incredibly dangerous for any mortal to hold due to suspending several gigasivert of ionising radiation.

Intelligence Classifications The Intelligence piloting a mobile combat unit is classified under three categories:
Autonomous Fully independent cognition, capable of reasoning and own actions. Restricted Limited cognition, able to execute complex tasks but not capable of improvising. Hybrid A subclass of 1. Autonomous, these systems are oriented around providing assistance to a humanoid pilot, but can steer the unit with little flexibility on its own. Blind, Deaf, Dumb (BDD) Barely considered intelligent, these units fully require a pilot to function.

      Individual segments of Orb &amp; Spire stones are capable of reacting to basic stimuli, whereas larger groups can coordinate movement and exhibit complex internal social dynamics between minerals of different kinds. This leads to the assumption of internal hierarchies and a linear advancement of complexity within as their mass grows.
Minerals of volcanic origin oftentimes expose themselves as the outer crust or hull of a accumulation, whereas sedimentary minerals comprise the internal structures.
