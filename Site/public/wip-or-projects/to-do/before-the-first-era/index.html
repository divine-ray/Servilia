<p><em>Yaldabaoth</em> (goddess of flesh) created humans,
<a href="....%5CBeings%5CGods%20and%20Deities%5CMekhane.md">Mekhane</a> gifted them machines and invention.
Yaldabaoth intended them to be uncultured and rather wild, like animals.
Mekhane wanted them to strive for greatness, using machines and the power of sciences.</p>
<p>This led to a <a href="....%5COverviews%5CPrime%20Clash%20of%20Nolka%20vs%20Mekhanites.md">severe conflict</a>, arms race and eventual escalation in global war between the both factions, devastating humanity as a whole in the events of the <em>Nølkā-Mekhanite War</em> (save for those species who were above human clashing).
Only splinter groups remained, but those are what now drives the <a href="....%5CGroupings%5CCults%20and%20Religions%5CChildren%20of%20The%20Flame.md">Children of The Flame</a>, <em>Nølkā</em> and <a href="....%5CGroupings%5CCults%20and%20Religions%5CFollowers%20of%20Mekhane.md">Mekhanite</a>.
Arriving slightly later is the following to the Cold, the <em>Ghiaccia Conclave</em>.
The Children have formed in crusades against the undying and cold, as their flames can rid the <a href="....%5COverviews%5CConcepts%5CCurse%20of%20the%20Undead.md">Curse of the Undead</a> and <a href="....%5CGroupings%5CFactions%5CThe%20Cold.md">The Cold</a>, which is the enduring descendant of lively weaponry employed by the <em>Nølkā</em>.
Mekhane shattered during this fight into many components and pieces, <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CAreas%5CEmpire%20of%20Thylyist%5CHeart%20of%20Mekhane.md">one of which</a> drives the entire Empire <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CAreas%5CEmpire%20of%20Thylyist%5CEmpire%20of%20Thylyist.md">Thylyist</a>. Some managed to escape into the plane of Mechanus, others into the vast eternal sea. It is seen as the duty and holy goal of the Mekhanites perform <em>His Divine Reassembly</em>.</p>
<p>And presumably the <em>Nølkā-Mekhanite War</em> is the original event that turned Schi ut-Pulá depressed, as she did not foresee the followers of her &ldquo;friends&rdquo; annihilate each other. <del>shortly turned into the undying and such</del>
The Curse of the Undead and the Cold are the final retaliation strikes by the <em>Nølkā</em> against the people of mekhane, knowing they&rsquo;ll bring misery for eternity to come.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-of-dragons-and-lavish">Introduction of Dragons and Lavish</h2>
<p>honestly, fuck knows
though I&rsquo;m thinking that the lavish took the ways of modifying the flesh from the Nølka and turned it into their powerful biotechnology. so I&rsquo;m presuming that the flooding of the Palga basin happened after the War of Flesh, as humanity was decimated and no longer served a threat. From there on its known what happens, etc.</p>
<h3 id="dragons">Dragons</h3>
<p>for the time being I&rsquo;m going to say that some gods/Schnūt collaborated on making a &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; species, which kinda failed once chromatic dragons started to exist.
thing is that they&rsquo;re the oldest sentient species alive on Schi.</p>
<h3 id="twilit">Twilit</h3>
<p>about the Twilight strain I&rsquo;m assuming that within the great woe of <a href="....%5CBeings%5CGods%20and%20Deities%5CCelestial%20Family%5CSchi%20ut-Pula.md">Schi ut-Pula</a> abandoning Schi greatly disturbed the young twilight, which made it leak into the population and effectively seeding the strain which resulted in Amarisk mages aka Sorcerers.</p>
<p>due to Schi ut-pula forsaking herself the twilight lost it&rsquo;s anchor/grip on another entity to converse to, which greatly caused it to turn unstable in itself, as if abandoned by a parental figure (<a href="....%5COverviews%5CConcepts%5CEchoes.md">Echoes</a>). the twilight also &ldquo;gifted&rdquo; humanity the ability to interacct with it, which turned out to be a one-sided relationship, which made it suffer further.</p>
