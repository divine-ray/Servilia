<p><strong>During the end of the First Era</strong>
The <a href="....%5CHistory%5CEras%5CThe%20Second%20Era%5CFall.md">carnage</a> brought upon them<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> caused the few surviving citizens to go insane from the trauma, tearing their local twilit continuum apart. This caused the orderly disassembly of Tombstone, as their buildings were infused with twilit and Amarisk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!INFO]- outdated
basically the faceless now inhibiting Tombstone were somehow affiliated to the immense pool of knowledge that the archive of old (thylyist + lavish) is/was
this made them capable of producing the <a href="....%5CItems%5CWeaponry%5CPropelled%20Projectile%5COA-WS%20BST%20Model%207%E2%81%BF.md">OA-WS BST Model 7‚Åø</a> amongst other now-legendary arms and tools</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m thinking of descendants of lavish pseudoneo or independent humanoids that somehow got into relations with lavish, and refined their tech for bipedal, land use</p>
<p>after their <a href="....%5CHistory%5CEras%5CThe%20Second%20Era%5CFall.md">Fall</a> the undead ghetto sepulchre got created, carved into the extensive cave system beneath the ninth forest
the undead are NOT related to Tombstone or the faceless or any of that, they just took the place</p>
<p>though i would claim that the two hangmen are likely citizens of tombstone who got executed in the political instabilities prior to the fall</p>
<p>(file recovery my beloved)</p>
