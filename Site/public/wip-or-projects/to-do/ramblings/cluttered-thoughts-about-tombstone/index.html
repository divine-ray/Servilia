The city core is looking like a cubist painting, perfectly rectangular and squared. further out, it looses this pattern, turning into a lot of rounded and organic shapes, which are more welcoming towards spirits and other magical beings.
<em>sacred alder trees</em>, as those from <a href="....%5CDh%C3%A2t%20%C3%BAt-Bhadan.md">Dhât út-Bhadan</a> are common around here (as they&rsquo;re the only comfortable hosuing for dragons). They&rsquo;re neatly trimmed into massive, sculpted bonsai trees, with each branch plateau providing resting space to several adult dragons.</p>
<p><a href="......%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CNinth%20Forest%5CCourt%20of%20Storms.md">Court of Storms</a>: big. a court hall without proper roof, seated with the eleven masked judges and <em>The One Who Judges</em>.
The One is a amalgam of Vessel masks, warped and fused into a big, floating mass? amalgam? thing. The gaps between the masks are filled with a swirly goop, coloured red and deep purple. as of present, it has been ripped apart and its fragments have been repurposed in vessels.
the one is possibly a central node to tombstone&rsquo;s amarisk and twilight fabric and etc (as in, it conducts amarisk for easier use), and it&rsquo;s destruction/death made a lot of the buildings fail and crumble.
Moreso, it acted as relay to the fountainhead.</p>
