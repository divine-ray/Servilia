<em>cloaked in shadows</em>, they are aware of their observer,
staring into the unfortunate soul which ends caught in their glimpse.
They know what you did; what sins you committed; whom you saved; whom you betrayed.
With thine eyes we see all.
These eyes are yours.
A blink, and they‘re gone.</p>
<p>What will you make of this unlikely concurrence?
Will you change your ways, knowing what you have done?
Or will you carry on living your life, pretending to be innocent?#
One Day. One Day those who you have left behind, scarred and scared, will come for you.
They will take back what you scoundrel took of them.
The demands you impose are taxing, ridiculous and insane. It is nothing that will be left alone or to rot, it is a burning memory.
Always present in the back of their mind, your actions strike forlorn bells in dissonance.
The trail of bloodied corpses and dying men and women alike paints a unsightly stain on your perfect masquerade.</p>
