<p>and this addition would provide a sensical bridge for the empire of Thylyist to decay from the insides though the hands of the True Machinists to the futuristic Amida and all that entails</p>
<p>effectively, through recent events, a splinter group of Mekhane’s Followers has gained notable influence and power, driven by their belief that the followers are abusing and raping the blessed machine, against it’s divine purpose</p>
<p>these true machinists strive to break the dogmata of regression and paralysis of developing, while also rejecting the human flesh, their very selves as embrace to the blessed machine^[![[Providence]]]</p>
<p>so the True Machinists are scheming to overthrow the Followers and their warriors to embrace the outside world again, as they have been locked down in their fortifications for generations</p>
