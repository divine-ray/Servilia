<p>something about a metaphorical window representing the peephole of the soul to the world, which could be broken somehow (possible metaphor for transcendence)</p>
<p>Each soul is only a visitor from <em>A Realm Beyond</em>, only tied into the mortal shell.
Souls without any coherence and such enter a state of degenerate matter, known as <a href="....%5COverviews%5CConcepts%5CMagic%20System%5CAmarisk.md">Amarisk</a> or <a href="....%5CGroupings%5CFactions%5CSpirits.md">Spirits</a>. Exposure to too much entropy and chaos can deteriorate souls, deform them until they cannot reside in a physical body anymore, but need special procedures (<a href="....%5CHistory%5CStory%20Snippets%5CBirth%20of%20Energy.md">Birth of Energy</a>) to be materialised.</p>
<p>This opens the questions of &ldquo;Where are souls formed?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where does amarisk gain coherence to become a soul?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is it possible to reverse the deformation of a soul?&rdquo;
And the question of &ldquo;Where does the soul go after the death of it&rsquo;s shell?&rdquo; is answered by the entire dilemma of the Undead and Charon being broken.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
That being the soul being unable to depart from the mortal vessel, thus being forced to reside in the decaying body which is leeching this soul&rsquo;s power.
The soul is facing progressing decay as its very energy is suspending the body, eventually leading to madness and frenzy if not ailed.</p>
<p>In case of extreme damage to the body under certain violent circumstances, the soul may escape the shell and eventually turn into a ghastly shape, much akin to <a href="....%5CGroupings%5CFactions%5CSpirits.md">Spirits</a>, filled with everlasting thirst of vengeance.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>#History
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apologies in advance; i wrote this at 2am whilst being unable to sleep. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>mekhane and yalgabaoth create humanity
conflict ensues after millennia of peace
the <em>Nølkā-Mekhanite War</em> is fought, resulting in diaspora and destruction of all involved
during all this, the lavish vaulted and hid away all their resources and units
&hellip; (time passes)
the Nølkā are banished into the ancient exile, with the mountains <em>Raising</em> for them
their isolation causes them to shape their unique culture, while the few remaining Nølkā remain bitter and resentful</p>
<h3 id="diverging-branch">diverging branch</h3>
<p>here, after the war, the mekhanites ally with the lavish
Frisco bay confederation was never founded
the alliance instead manages to assemble mekhane again
in this timeline, mekhane guides humanity (and in turn, the lavish) to arcane engineering, eventually leading up to arcane engineering
eventually, spelljammers are devised as means to travel across the eternal sea</p>
<h3 id="mainline-reality">mainline reality</h3>
<p>the mekhanites bunch up in thylylist after the war, starting their descent into isolationism
the <a href="....%5CHistory%5CIncidents%20and%20Events%5CBetrayal.md">Betrayal</a> happens, effectively empowering the morally bankrupt &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; priests etc
information from before the war is preserved and kept undisclosed and inaccessible to the public, effectively stripping the populace of any awareness of their history and surroundings
this leaves them very susceptible to the tall tales and outright propaganda and misinformation campaigns
pseudoneo species are captured and terribly abused into bloodlust-driven monsters of violence and war
the council realises the immense potential on these beings and decides to eradicate the Lavish Empire using the last stockpiles of magical weapons from before the war, and more importantly, the armies of automatons left over and dotted across the landscape (<a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CLong%20Savannah%5CSentinel%20of%20Steel.md">Sentinel of Steel</a>)
beinging forth the <a href="....%5CHistory%5CEras%5CThe%20Second%20Era%5CFall.md">Fall</a>/<em>Fall of the Lavish</em>
★time passes</p>
<p>the Frisco bay confederation is founded from refugees and other stragglers, placing themselves №1 in scientific and economic development
