veiled and unseen, they blend into the night.
snug they are, these garments.
comfortable, warming against the freezing tongues
and protecting from the acidic spit
lifesaving at night, vanished by day
who but a fool would pride themselves in such a volatile comfort</p>
<p>are they really there, if they cant be witnessed?
what is credibility without reason, without&hellip;</p>
<p>rest your wicked bones on my harrowed heart
shall they sleep
until they are needed again
to carry your burden of being
of trying to be someone
in this lifelong masquerade, disguised as comedy, disguised as paradise
under which layers
true meaning has been lost
what is reality?
is it what you see, feel, perceive?
the anguish of existence?
we won&rsquo;t tell. because we can&rsquo;t&hellip;
orifices sewn shut, entrapped in this fleshy prison</p>
<p>winds are wailing, soaring
forcing their noise into our ear - ears - perception
needing us to steer clear, fight them
but why fight?
what is the fighting for, if not for chasing allusions, promises of dubious security</p>
<p>just like the man i pretended to be, threatened, i want to retreat and never be seen again
but the forces make me appear at the same spot and same time, on the next day
there&rsquo;s always already someone there instead of us
but they could be there for us</p>
<p>what is a moment of clarity to a muddled pit other than salvation
mustn&rsquo;t it be heavenly, divine in nature
genuine resolve from what it used to be
but with the grant that it will be over now</p>
<p>what little benefit is there to decorating the flesh we haunt if not for vanity
a fracture of bone, never healed
fragments and shrapnel of such
leading to pain in every move
every breath <code>you</code> take
all these struggles for nothing but judgement of others
indeed, judgement is inevitable</p>
<p>somewhere in this night sky
you know someone is there
there for you
watching you
knowing you&rsquo;re here, but they&rsquo;re there.
the unreachable distance makes them suffer, makes you suffer
knowing you will never see them
they will never see you
never find
the love you have been promised from your parents
who failed in their only task</p>
<p>but
you are loved
you are watched
you are missed</p>
