Assuming they’re each not trying to kill everyone or bring into the influence of their respective heart,
They might just be trying to do <code>something that aids the world</code>, probably related to the Curse of Undying because both cold and flame can revert/stall the decay of the body and or allow the soul to escape.</p>

<p>by that definition, the mekhanite <a href="....%5CGroupings%5CCults%20and%20Religions%5CTrue%20Machinists.md">True Machinists</a> are a NRM, as it rejects a part of the taught beliefs, propagating the reformation of the human vessel into something holy to the machine
seeing that the splinter group might be reformist against the established teachings of the mekhanites, they <del>might be</del> <em>are</em> <strong>those</strong> that fasten the decay and downfall of Thylyist/Council</p>
<hr>
<p>On that note, the <a href="....%5CGroupings%5CCults%20and%20Religions%5COblivion%20Lodge.md">Oblivion Lodge</a> should also be revisited since they are the stereotypical carbon copy doomsday cult which wants to bring the end of the world as see know it.
that’s stupid</p>
<p>possibly a <em>little subgroup of the lunatics</em> struggling to study the <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CSea%20Major%5CAstral%20Ocean%5CKa%C3%A1-Rav%20Isles%5CLunar%20Gateways.md">Lunar Gateways</a> and <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CSea%20Major%5CAstral%20Ocean%5CKa%C3%A1-Rav%20Isles%5CThe%20Tellurion.md">The Tellurion</a></p>
<p>some other group #TODO to study the way of the soul through <em>Styx</em>, <em>Acheron</em> and into the <em>Afterlives</em> (and hells/heavens, respectively) to achieve the journey to paradise, off the mortal realm.</p>
<p><a href="....%5CGroupings%5COrganisations%5CThe%20Zubin%20Society.md">The Zubin Society</a> as NRM with the goal to uncouple the soul from the body.
Possibly is distantly related to a old split-off from the Nolka, as they overlap in their lost prophet and try to surpass the mortal body, as seen above.</p>
