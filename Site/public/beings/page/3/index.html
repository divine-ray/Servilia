      Colours converging, emerging from the blended mass they just collapsed into. Swirling liquids, like oil on water that protests unification, insisting on its individuality. As if that was not lost already to the higher dynamics, which this colour does not know. And it does not care, because it simply will be. Be itself. All confined within shapes, still rotating in itself, maybe folding and turning in ways that makes a rationale vomit.

      The skeletal remains of The Former Davern King bound under the fort-castle of Auvergne.
He remains aware, having to look at the world from below. He was the first king to sit atop the throne of ascension, and the last to be granted divine reason by it. In the end, everything eventually demands, and forcibly takes, its toll.
Revered to as God by the citizens and people of Davern, yet He has been forgotten if not for folk and rumours.

      I first spotted this dignified creature in what i thought to be a gust of wind. After some rest, I managed to get a sight on a distant individual, from which I have been blown away by the splendour of colours and almost divine curves. They are serpents, given colourful feathered wings, and bearing a maw akin to a beak.
When I tried to approach their gathering of three, all of them quickly slithered away, and took to the skies in a single, smooth motion.
