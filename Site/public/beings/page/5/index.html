      #Ancients #Tabañaya
Former Resident of Londo, witness of the Fall of Londo to Vessels.
Despite bearing a mature iteration of a Premature Heart of Cold, they got killed in that raid.
This unjust death caused him to get reborn as widergänger, with the purpose to fight the cause of the loose vessels.
Thus, he is fighting to get into the Thylyist Council (as they are versed with technology and are disliking supernatural powers), and to manipulate them into combating the Void.

Couldn&rsquo;t you vermin spare a petty penny for the one who brings you salvation from your wretched coil?
The Ferryman, he who hauls the souls of the deceased to the Afterlives over Styx and across Acheron.

      The god of Fear and Hunger, sharing family with the Apocalyptic Quartet of Death, Famine, Warfarefare and Conquest. Wicked, outright wrong, this warped tyrant is defying creation, placing itself unruly in the place of the just judge of death and decay. Arose from a human vessel that only experienced fear and hunger in its short life, which has been ended through ritual means.
The few worshippers of this deity are typically struck with misery and pray for a betterment of their situation through a divine act.

      Divinity, which transcended the boundaries of a vessel. But the lack of a body and memory thereof comes with a burden; bearing eternity as euclidean mind takes its toll. Insanity and Boredom conjoined, turning their infinite power into a tool to recklessly manipulate the cosmos for their mere entertainment. They simply grew tired of skirmishing Yet Another War or weaving intrigue amongst themselves or being tied down as absolute but disabled observers in the flow of time.

She appears as a infinitely long and massive worm, which is merely constructed from a many floating rings that, given the nature of this realm, eventually trail off into the darkness.

      Disembodied Shnūt, manifested concept of navigation using stellar constellations. Usually benevolent towards travellers, aiding their voyages. adored by many (past) civilisations as deity of travel. Typically falsely associated with starlight itself, through which it is forced to meet the Queen of Shadows. Commonly depicted as derivatives of compass roses, as this emblem both provides context to maps and pleads the blessing of this entity.
It is capable of altering starlight to guide and influence people.

      The manifestation of The Void, appearing as gigantic glowing jellyfish floating above an infinity of nothing. Easily considered to be one of the major antagonistic forces, as it envies the material plane of it&rsquo;s details and features.
Witnessing this apparition already allows the Void into the mind of the observer, tearing it to shreds in it&rsquo;s eternal rage and envy. It is suspended in eternal envy and jealousy turned wrath against the material plane and the celestials for being something, whilst it is the absolute nothing.
