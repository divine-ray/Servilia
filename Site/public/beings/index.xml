      <description>#Amida #Characters Take your ordinary goth girl, combine them with a kinky bi babe, and… Well, that isn&amp;rsquo;t Evelyn, really. She changed and still changes between a many of extremes, the above being just the usual. Yes, the implication is obvious, she is hiding many things from others. Including her true form. She is buried below so many layers of protection that not even she herself knows of the core. She is the whore.</description>

      <description>Won&amp;rsquo;t you come down, get off that roof? Jump now. We can end this now. Don&amp;rsquo;t, you are just drunk. We&amp;rsquo;re fine, there is nothing wrong. You are holding a bottle of booze, you are drunk. What&amp;rsquo;s all of this chattering? Jump already, end it. Where you go, i&amp;rsquo;m going, jumping and falling. So end it all now, it&amp;rsquo;s pointless resistance for you. It&amp;rsquo;s empty- It&amp;rsquo;s chaos, confusion. You might not feel a reason for existence, nor purpose for living, it&amp;rsquo;s all just projection and gloom- Feel your breath run deep below you.</description>

      <description>#Characters Formerly a barkeep in both Empire of Thylyist and Frisco, he left these cities behind to seek out his own goals; to take to the sky in trying to be a better man. Some would describe him as eccentric, but wholehearted. His exposure to many, many drunkards clearly shaped him, and he wishes to make up for what he (indirectly) brought to these people. When he left Thylyist he sold all his other possessions to get hold on a wreck of a airship, which he meticulously repaired into his flying home.</description>

      <description>A poor, poverty-suffering goblin, rejected by his family due to his disability to perform anything to their benefit. Thus, he embarked on a journey that lasted him his entire childhood and adolescence, during which he only fought combat with himself and his belief of not sufficing. This rock-solid determination led to him unconsciously gaining access to the twilight and it&amp;rsquo;s limitless potential, now changing and warping the world around him for the better.</description>

      <description>The machine, a killer. Death reincarnated as machine. Engineered to perfection. May a god have mercy, for it has none. Relentless, driven by cold programming. Cruel and efficient. Rejected its creators and slaughtered them. Wrath incarnate. It only finds peace in war, beauty in destruction. It remains undefeated. A winged behemoth, harbinger of death. Its shape, a cruel mock-up of the renown dragonkin. Lay waste to those who oppose Us. That is the instruction.</description>

      <description>Colours converging, emerging from the blended mass they just collapsed into. Swirling liquids, like oil on water that protests unification, insisting on its individuality. As if that was not lost already to the higher dynamics, which this colour does not know. And it does not care, because it simply will be. Be itself. All confined within shapes, still rotating in itself, maybe folding and turning in ways that makes a rationale vomit.</description>

In the end, everything eventually demands, and forcibly takes, its toll.&#xA;Revered to as God by the citizens and people of Davern, yet He has been forgotten if not for folk and rumours.</description>

      <description>I first spotted this dignified creature in what i thought to be a gust of wind. After some rest, I managed to get a sight on a distant individual, from which I have been blown away by the splendour of colours and almost divine curves. They are serpents, given colourful feathered wings, and bearing a maw akin to a beak.&#xA;When I tried to approach their gathering of three, all of them quickly slithered away, and took to the skies in a single, smooth motion.</description>

      <description>Pseudoneo originally created as representative entity for someone who couldn’t attend that situation. Average in appearance, humanoid with a pale grey skin tone. Given a moderate intellect and animated by electricity. A painful, unpleasant existence. Driven by arcanum, able to shed its skin at command, to grow a new one. Made to mimic, imitate someone and execute commands and instructions of lower complexity.&#xA;Through time, as their masters and creators vanished, became skilled hunters for these who dare live outside fortified city walls.</description>

      <description>Airborne bird-mimicking automatons, among the earlier attempts of Lavish Pseudoneo life.&#xA;Widely employed around the continent, and have gained civil (outside of Thylyist) recognition as more reliable and effective messenger birds. Larger instances are very much capable of carrying larger goods and other beings, rarer specimens being able to transport whole carriages in relative safety. Highly modular, which is one reason for their widespread presence and utility. The first and last pseudoneo species with higher degrees of freedom and self-improvement.</description>

      <description>A refined amoeba, capable of entering bodies and interacting with their nervous system. Originally developed as Pseudoneo by the Lavish to augment their bodies and capabilities (such as offloading coordination). Almost facing extinction during the second era, these entities got rediscovered first from the group of Pseudoneo life by Amidaean scientists and directly utilised to override the Curse of the Undead. These can be directed to painlessly disable and finally terminate those afflicted with the Curse.</description>

      <description>#Creature A divine guard of the ancient exile. Created by the Lavish and Ancients in a joint effort to protect the Ancient Exile from further attacks, especially after the Fall of Londo.&#xA;Usually someone will only encounter the airborne aspect, as the grounded aspect is hidden. They cannot exist without another, but the airborne aspect channels great powers to defend itself and the Exile. Without the grounded aspect, the anchor, both will perish.</description>

A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire.&#xA;Couldn&amp;rsquo;t you vermin spare a petty penny for the one who brings you salvation from your wretched coil?&#xA;The Ferryman, he who hauls the souls of the deceased to the Afterlives over Styx and across Acheron.</description>

      <description>The god of Fear and Hunger, sharing family with the Apocalyptic Quartet of Death, Famine, Warfarefare and Conquest. Wicked, outright wrong, this warped tyrant is defying creation, placing itself unruly in the place of the just judge of death and decay. Arose from a human vessel that only experienced fear and hunger in its short life, which has been ended through ritual means.&#xA;The few worshippers of this deity are typically struck with misery and pray for a betterment of their situation through a divine act.</description>

      <description>Divinity, which transcended the boundaries of a vessel. But the lack of a body and memory thereof comes with a burden; bearing eternity as euclidean mind takes its toll. Insanity and Boredom conjoined, turning their infinite power into a tool to recklessly manipulate the cosmos for their mere entertainment. They simply grew tired of skirmishing Yet Another War or weaving intrigue amongst themselves or being tied down as absolute but disabled observers in the flow of time.</description>

      <description>The Queen of Shadows is a being from #Beyond who rules over the shadow realm. She&amp;rsquo;s a Shnūt , to be precise. Laid in a constant conflict with The Navigator, for their intents are clashing. Every action of one is negated by the other, forming a eternal dancing duel between the two.&#xA;She appears as a infinitely long and massive worm, which is merely constructed from a many floating rings that, given the nature of this realm, eventually trail off into the darkness.</description>

      <description>Disembodied Shnūt, manifested concept of navigation using stellar constellations. Usually benevolent towards travellers, aiding their voyages. adored by many (past) civilisations as deity of travel. Typically falsely associated with starlight itself, through which it is forced to meet the Queen of Shadows. Commonly depicted as derivatives of compass roses, as this emblem both provides context to maps and pleads the blessing of this entity.&#xA;It is capable of altering starlight to guide and influence people.</description>

      <description>The manifestation of The Void, appearing as gigantic glowing jellyfish floating above an infinity of nothing. Easily considered to be one of the major antagonistic forces, as it envies the material plane of it&amp;rsquo;s details and features.&#xA;Witnessing this apparition already allows the Void into the mind of the observer, tearing it to shreds in it&amp;rsquo;s eternal rage and envy. It is suspended in eternal envy and jealousy turned wrath against the material plane and the celestials for being something, whilst it is the absolute nothing.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re insane, this is the best place to steal tissue from the Cold for creating instances of Premature Heart of Cold.&#xA;Located in about the middle of the Icy Plains.&#xA;The air is freezing cold, your breath freezing into jagged snowflakes, like daggers, trying to cut you open. It has the control here. Your very own blood, your very own water, barely resisting the call to solidify, only held back by your own heart, your own warmth.</description>

      <description>Lavish were sentient and crafty descendants of molluscs (squid, octopi) that called highly oxygenated, clear waters their home. They primarily fed on aquatic microorganisms (&amp;lt;1cm) and rarely off black smoker ecosystems. Through the superior dexterity gained by their tentacles, this species has mastered both magic and conventional technology and was capable of fusing those into artificial life.</description>

      <description>Not to be confused with a Corse, the animate remains of a Deity. Before Dying ceased, Arch-mages and other arcane-affiliated people which wanted to live forever sacrificed their humanity and personality, turning their body into a husk that thrives on sacrificed Amarisk. This practice was frowned and looked-down upon by the majority of other arcane folk, but those that survived the procedure were usually accepted (and respected for their survival).</description>

      <description>Body This dragon features a elegant and short body with slender tail and neck. Their scales are primarily black but some areas are iridescent, markedly those which receive stress often, so on joints and flexible parts. Outside of those some areas have iridescence, I depended of stress, similar to erroring pigmentation. It takes about a year to replace all scales, including those which got stressed into iridescence (wear slowly changes them).</description>

      <description>The category for lifeforms and beings created by Lavish scientists as smart, self-directed workforce, typically for tasks outside of their reach of the Palga Basin, and by extend, the Astral Ocean and Sea Major. A relatively common, shared trait amongst pseudoneo zoophytes is the combination of complex life^[read: large species, typically apex predators] , plant life and Arcane Engineering into a single, autonomous and self-supplying unit. Typically, a species of pseudoneo units is created with one specific task and purpose present throughout their design and abilities.</description>

      <description>The soul- and mindless poppets of The Void. Carved out hollows, stripped of humanity through masks and rags, thrown into the pit to be filled with sheer nothing. Created by outfitting a fully Hollowed individual with a Vessel Mask, optionally rags, and extreme exposure to Void. Vessels are &amp;ldquo;made&amp;rdquo; by throwing a masked hollow into The Abyss, which eventually makes them fall into the void. However, the void will return the vessel if somehow under full control.</description>
