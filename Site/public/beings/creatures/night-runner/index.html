Usually hides within shadows around the Hollow Mountains and The Fountainhead.

<h3 id="lost-vessel-theory">Lost Vessel Theory</h3>
<p>These are likely Vessels without Mask which are loose and running wild.
Carrying any Vessel components (cloth, mask) will gain their attention regardless of position and such, and they will attempt to acquire the components for themselves.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Understanding Celestial and Abyssal makes them directly addressable (100% chance) and allows the player to understand them. Still increases insanity.</p>
<p>Directly addressing these with names may turn them docile again.</p>
<p>Spoken Magic and Grandam Cant is highly effective and makes them vanish.</p>
