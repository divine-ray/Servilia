Possibly hollow or undead people which have lost all mental integrity.</p>

<p>Their facial features are all destroyed, covered below horrible scars, seem to shape eerie patterns. You have a uneasy feeling trying to make out what these patterns mean. That shadow just moved, didn&rsquo;t it?
These scars likely come from self-imposed injuries from their uncut nails, which would place a dragon in envy.
In fact, their entire body appears to be mistreated and neglected, starved to the bone, uncut hair&hellip; but&hellip; They seem to remember to wash themselves. Odd.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]- Outdated
Their faces are covered in long and poorly-healed scars, likely sourcing from scratching themselves with their horribly elongated nails that resemble talons or claws.
Their hair is also extremely mistreated, as with the rest of their body.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Answering them with sung Gradam Cant is likely (1d100,x&gt;40) going to calm them, and some lore will be revealed.</p>
<p>Singing to them with <a href="..%5CCharacters%20and%20People%5CExiled%5CMarilee,%20the%20Songstress.md">Marilee, the Songstress</a>&rsquo; blessing will ease their mind and they can be communicated with using nonverbal means (as their mouth and ways of vocalisation are ruined).</p>
<p>(Their mental state is still pretty broken, and on the development of a toddler, 3yo.)</p>
<h3 id="chanting">Chanting</h3>
<p>They can be heard chanting this in a sobbing and deranged manner, as long as they don&rsquo;t perceive someone else:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am tired of punching in the wind<br>
I am tired of letting it all in<br>
And I should eat you up and spit you right out<br>
I should not care but I don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>So I take off my face<br>
Because it reminds me of how it all went wrong<br>
And I pull out my tongue<br>
Because it reminds me of how it all went wrong</p>
<p>I am sorry for the trouble, I suppose<br>
My blood runs red but my body feels so cold<br>
I guess I could swim for days in the salty sea<br>
But in the end the waves will discolour me</p>
<p>So I take off my face<br>
Because it reminds me of how it all went wrong<br>
And I pull out my tongue<br>
Because it reminds me of how it all went wrong<br>
And I cough up my lungs<br>
Because they remind me of how it all went wrong<br>
And I leave in my heart<br>
Because I don&rsquo;t want to stay in the dark</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If they are addressed or possibly threatened, they will stop chanting and start to claw at themselves and anyone nearby, which also injures any people observing them within a ca. 9m radius.</p>
<p>Those &ldquo;methods&rdquo; are the ones mentioned in their chanting.</p>
<p><em>All of these crippled attacks remain until respawn or proper treatment:</em></p>
