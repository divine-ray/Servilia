Tormented fire elementals, corrupted by the pained twilight and sweeps of void.
Only present within the wastes, most commonly around hot spots.
Easily defeated by water or by casting them into a suitable vessel, such as a Strange Flask, which will make the flask refill slowly by absorbing environmental heat.
Raises the environment temperature for a single being/victim by 5°c per round.
