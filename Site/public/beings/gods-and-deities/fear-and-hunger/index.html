Wicked, outright wrong, this warped tyrant is defying creation, placing itself unruly in the place of the just judge of death and decay.
Arose from a human vessel that only experienced fear and hunger in its short life, which has been ended through ritual means.</p>
<p>The few worshippers of this deity are typically struck with misery and pray for a betterment of their situation through a divine act.
These poor beggars, scum and scoundrel they may be, are met with one last resolution: true Death.
Actively rejected as foul and wrong by most, if not all organised religions, as this deity only brings misery and drags attention of the Apocalyptic Quartet.</p>
<p>No living person has ever bestowed their gaze upon the personification of misery, lest few who experienced hallucinations described <strong>it</strong> as starved, deformed humanoid, standing tall regardless.</p>
