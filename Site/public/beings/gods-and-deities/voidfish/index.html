Easily considered to be one of the major antagonistic forces, as it envies the material plane of it&rsquo;s details and features.</p>
<p>Witnessing this apparition already allows the Void into the mind of the observer, tearing it to shreds in it&rsquo;s eternal rage and envy.
It is suspended in eternal envy and jealousy turned wrath against the material plane and the <em>celestials</em> for being something, whilst it is the absolute nothing.
It&rsquo;s constant wrath and agony is making it &lsquo;scream&rsquo;, manifesting various odd or anomalous phenomenon in the <a href="....%5CRealms%5CPlanes%5CDark%20Domain%5CEternal%20Sea.md">Eternal Sea</a>, which eventually extends to the planets. A sufficiently advanced civilisation might be able to receive these screams as scrambled and incoherent radio transmissions.</p>
