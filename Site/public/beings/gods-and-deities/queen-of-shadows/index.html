She&rsquo;s a <em>Shnūt</em> , to be precise.

<p>She appears as a infinitely long and massive worm, which is merely constructed from a many floating rings that, given the nature of this realm, eventually trail off into the darkness.
The front end shapes as several shield shaped segments orbiting a ring, mimicking chelicerae.</p>
<p>Involved into the eternal fight of light vs dark as both the victim and offender.
She defends the <a href="....%5CRealms%5CPlanes%5CDark%20Domain%5CEmpire%20of%20Shadows.md">shadow realm</a> fiercely against intruders and foreign beings, but cares for her kin and servants wholeheartedly.</p>
