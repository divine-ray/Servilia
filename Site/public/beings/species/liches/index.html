<h3 id="creation-of-a-lich">Creation of a Lich</h3>
<p>The ritual of creating or transforming into a lich involves isolating the local fabric trough which would escape, and deliberately killing the subject, which forces the soul out of the body.
To disrupt the local fabric and Twilit,
But through the disrupting the local fabric, it cannot get ferried into the <em>Afterlives</em>, and therefore must be captured in a vessel, which will become the Lich, with all the memories of the former person.
The vessel must be prepared beforehand, and is commonly a animated corpse or construct, both of which cases require tremendous effort and expertise to succeed.
Secondary to the procedure is creating a container which acts as backup copy of the soul, which can store enough Amarisk to recreate/mend the vessel in case of injuries. Said container is usually a urn, but any watertight container suffices. However, it must be able to contain the soul within, which is typically done by cladding the inside with arcanophobe materials like silver, which gets engraved with runes and other words of banishment and containment. Antimemetic seals and such might&rsquo;ve been used as well.</p>
