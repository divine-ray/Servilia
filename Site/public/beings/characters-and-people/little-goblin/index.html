Thus, he embarked on a journey that lasted him his entire childhood and adolescence, during which he only fought combat with himself and his belief of not sufficing.
This rock-solid determination led to him unconsciously gaining access to the twilight and it&rsquo;s limitless potential, now changing and warping the world around him for the better.
During his end- and relentless wandering, he eventually got confined into the <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CHollow%20Mountains%5CAncient%20Exile.md">Ancient Exile</a>, where he&rsquo;d settle in Arno after witnessing <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CHollow%20Mountains%5CAncient%20Exile%5CLondo.md">the Fall</a>.
His ability to tap the twilight grew ever stronger from the immense flows of Amarisk running through the Exile, until reaching past the confines of Schi.</p>
<hr>
<p>He can make the sun explode</p>
<p>Resides in Londo and Arno due to this power</p>
<p>The party has to convince him that he is valid and alright without him needing to be strong and brave</p>
<p>He worked hard for this, alright? He wanted to achieve something, and show his family that he is powerful and worthy.</p>
<p>The party gets to know him as random encounter when going through Arno or Londo.</p>
<p>His Family rejected him as the odd little kid who aint of use or purpose, so he embarked on a journey far and wide to find his purpose.</p>
<p>Along the way he picked up the ability to manipulate the sun.</p>
