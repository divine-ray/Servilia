She governs smaller squadrons of <a href="Undead%20Cat.md">undead cats</a> for her elusive and mischievous plans. Notably, those include intelligence and spying activities, which yield her a sizable knowledge of both international political diplomacy and a poor man&rsquo;s troubles.</p>
<p>Born handmaid, she always aimed to cause lesser chaos in the world without hurting anyone, as vengeance to those who forced her into this unwanted and belittling role.
Essentially a rebel against the norms and rigid structures, therefore she favours odd and rare clothing such as wide-swaying robes worthy of a god-emperor, glowing and flowing with the chaotic energies of life and death.</p>
