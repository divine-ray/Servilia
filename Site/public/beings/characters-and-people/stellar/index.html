Swirling liquids, like oil on water that protests unification, insisting on its individuality.
As if that was not lost already to the higher dynamics, which this colour does not know.
And it does not care, because it simply will be. Be itself.
All confined within shapes, still rotating in itself, maybe folding and turning in ways that makes a rationale vomit.
A emblem for a face; colours for a body.
Lacking in substance, but making up character with radiation, both sentimental and molecular.
A star, confined and constrained into a shape, bent by will alone.
Yet the Will emerges from the shape. What a peculiar paradox.</p>
<hr>
<p>The ant lives its tiny life to its fullest, however that might be like. I don’t know what an ant’s ideal life looks like.
But the universe had a greater scheme to enact and bring about, and it involved this ant.
The ant, however, did not care, as it could not comprehend nor bother with these concepts.</p>
<hr>
<p>A single star is a speck of dust on the canvas of the eternal sea, yet each grain may be as our own, maternal and fostering life.
Some others might be living in eternal solitude, born and sentenced to die alone.</p>
