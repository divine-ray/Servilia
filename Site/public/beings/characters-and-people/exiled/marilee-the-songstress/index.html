<p>(She sorta adapted Cant into a sung form)</p>
<p>During her time, she ascended into almost being the guardian patron for those undying, which drew the attention of the <a href="......%5CGroupings%5CCults%20and%20Religions%5CChildren%20of%20The%20Flame.md">Children of The Flame</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>She has become Patron or Deity of Song, assisting devoted Bards.</li>
</ul>
<p>After several fatal attempts of the Children on her and the then-necropolis she got lethally injured and reached out to the fabled Cold, to heal her and to give a counterweight.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she was unaware about how <a href="......%5CGroupings%5CFactions%5CThe%20Cold.md">The Cold</a> functions and thus she did not prepare for its overtaking nature, and got completely frozen.</p>
<p>Existing in this unnatural state, most townsfolk rejected her and Marilee&rsquo;s popularity plummeted. The only few who still enjoyed her singing and such were the inhabitants of <a href="......%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CNinth%20Forest%5CSepulchre.md">Sepulchre</a>.</p>
<p>She then caught the attention of a ancient, whom was tasked or devoted to guarding Sepulchre. That ancient invited her over to the Exile, in attempts to combat the leeching Cold.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t help her either. This disappointment in &ldquo;the gods&rdquo; caused her to finally snap, falling into depression and sorrow.</p>
<p>She has given up herself, singing her song of sorrow and melancholy on a lone peak within the exile.</p>
<p>Some air elementals have picked up her story and song and are distributing her song across the realm, to those who want to listen to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>ghost winds and spirits may carry her song</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="on-encounter">On Encounter</h3>
<p>the party may give her a last audience and end her suffering via death.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Inspiration and motivation buff for 3d6 days)
<em>Or:</em> if one of the party members are Cursed or Ashen and thus carries Bottled Embers, they may offer her some (1d6+1) Embers and combat the Cold, which will give her new life force.</li>
<li>(Ability to learn sung Gradam Cant, notable reputation increase within Sepulchre, re-buff for bards)</li>
</ul>
