The Machine, divine, will be ridden of its meddlers, regain freedom from its slavery.
Through the freedom and our open walls, we strive forward through time, to progress.
To undo what our predecessors did wrong,
To reunite with those we once despised, conquered.
To lead the charge.
Onwards, you engineers, scientists, artists!
We shall be heard, our work be seen, our beliefs be praised!
The machine shall learn, be met with forces of lightning, of vapour, of fire.
We must not forget the purity of metal, as it is our spine, what keeps us going.
May each of your creations be blessed, turned housing for the Ghost of Mekhane and His Fragments.</p>

<p>Effectively, the <a href="....%5CGroupings%5CCults%20and%20Religions%5CTrue%20Machinists.md">True Machinists</a> force down the <a href="....%5CGroupings%5CFactions%5CThylyian%5CCouncil%20of%20Thylyist.md">Council of Thylyist</a> and open Thylyist up again, allowing their knowledge of the Machine to be shared to the Frisco Confederation. The Confederation, in turn, connects all of the former empire to the <a href="....%5CGroupings%5COrganisations%5CServilian%20Railroad%20and%20Train%20Network.md">Servilian Railroad and Train Network</a>, which is getting <a href="..%5CTechnological%20Advancements%5CElectricity.md">electrified</a> under aid of Machinist Engineers.
This causes all of Servilia (spare for the Exile) to be mostly-united in a coherent economy and international relations, bringing forth a flourishing era of advancement in which the old ways of magic meet technology in computation and chemistry.
The fragments of Mekhane known to the Machinists are collected and reassembled in the now-publicly accessible halls of the <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CAreas%5CEmpire%20of%20Thylyist%5CCitadel%20of%20the%20Gear.md">Citadel</a>, with the Heart freed from its involuntary leeching. All in accordance to the New Construal of <em>His Divine Reassembly</em>, they develop bodily replacements much akin to Pseudoneo, empowered by the Spirit Mekhane.</p>
