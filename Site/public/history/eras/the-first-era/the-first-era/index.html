<h4 id="alliance-and-peace">Alliance and Peace</h4>
<p>The time during which Humans, Lavish and all others coexisted without conflict or war.
Alliances and collaborations between species were common, science and magic were thriving.</p>
<p>Lasted around {1200 earthen years}.</p>
<p>Thylyist developed into a fully-fledged nation/empire from the former fort installation of Thylyist, which sheltered the remains of the Mekhanites during the end of the <em>Nølkā-Mekhanite War</em>.
Lavish inland already existed and already was thriving in <a href="......%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CLong%20Savannah%5CPalga%20Basin%5CSyksa,%20Lavish%20Capital.md">Syksa, Lavish Capital</a>.
Pseudoneo development and &lsquo;production&rsquo;/genesis peaked in this time.
Dragonkin were looked upon for their extensive knowledge and bodily strength.</p>
<p>Knowledge was widely shared, preserved and broadened by groups such as the <a href="......%5CGroupings%5COrganisations%5CErudition%20Coven.md">Erudition Coven</a> and other organisations, which <a href="Archive%20of%20Old.md">still exist today.</a> Notably, during the later parts of the first Era, Humanity/Thylyist took inspirations from Lavish biotechnology and combined it with their remnants of Mekhane into powerful, vastly beneficial bio-mechanical machinery and constructs.</p>
<p>The Curse of Undead is known, but barely present (only about 5 from 100 deceased stay alive), those undying remain functional in society and are accepted widely.</p>
<p>The end of the First Era was foreshadowed by the Thylyian order to redirect the Fountainhead to commence the <em>Raising</em> of the Mountains to contain the Ancients.
A final echo of democracy was quelled after the <a href="......%5CGroupings%5CCults%20and%20Religions%5CFollowers%20of%20Mekhane.md">Mekhanites</a> executed the <a href="......%5CGroupings%5CFactions%5CThylyian%5CCouncil%20of%20Thylyist.md">Council of Thylyist</a> in the coup d&rsquo;état later known as <a href="....%5CIncidents%20and%20Events%5CBetrayal.md">Betrayal</a>.
Betrayal of their upheld goals, of liberty, of free thought. Turning down, turning to face the past and revering standstill and oppressing anyone who considers otherwise.</p>
<p>After the forcible gathering of apotheotic Nølkā and similar entities/people within the erected mountains, Thylyist turned the vast armadas of Pseudoneo entities against the lavish and <em>Varuú</em>, and then issued them^[The Pseudoneo.] to execute themselves, effectively reverting and stalling all progress made since the inception.</p>
