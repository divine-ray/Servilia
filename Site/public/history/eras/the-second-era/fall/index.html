as the large thing draw cross the sky and keep dropping its
unknown gifts which a
which kill what have we done wrong to draw the anger of these beings
who are clearly superior to us
what did we do wrong
someone help
it&rsquo;s all on fire
screams  terror   panic    the stench of dust from buildings collapsing
someone
help
we did nothing wrong
surely our govt will protect u
the govt will help us
smite those creatures away
no-one shall harm us again
let us rise, brothers, sisters and fellow siblings
let us reclaim and fight back
we shall not be suppressed by anyone
we are<br>
above all
we are ruling
i utter these words as a gunshot rings in my ear
and a shrapnel tears through my body,
not caring of me
it obeys physics
. . .</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>hours later
the creature has stopped giving its gifts
our city lies in ruins
i cannot find anyone i know
everyone just on the floor
dead or alive, a difference
so small i cannot tell
where is
my family
my friend
my pet
my mind
me
help</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>another time
more sirens
more death and devastation
for no purpose</p>
<p>i am sorry this is always this is always how this goes
the wind blows loudest when you got your eyes closed
but i never changed a single colour that i breathe
we are tired of letting it all in
we are tired of punching in the wind
so i take off my face
i do not want to be recognised
i want to loose myself
without loosing my life
thats a lie
and i tear at my lungs
they remind me how it all went
wrong</p>
<p>so i cower
in the corner of what used to be a
my
house..
i cannot breathe
my lungs are torn
my throat is choked
choked by the rubble i ate
to satisfy a false hunger</p>
<p>someone has
seen me
i wimper in fear
is it one of the gift givers
no
they walk
i cry
they come nearer
they speak
a language unknown
i answer
but they only hear screams
i scream
in fear
a metal shimmer
i weep in fear
they
stop
stop moving
dropped to their knees,
scratching open their face
and they take
off their face
because it reminds me how it all
went wrong
and they pull
out their lung
because it reminds me how it all
went wrong
they
died
curled in anguish i weep
to remember,  this tragic individual</p>
