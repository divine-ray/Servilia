I have these <a href="Songbird">wings</a>, but they are shattered and limp. Someone must&rsquo;ve ripped them off their original body, they&rsquo;re covered in blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Healer, doctor, tell me, how can these wings heal?&rdquo;
&ldquo;They will not heal, they are dead, and starting to rot.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But doctor, there must be a way they can recover! I want to reach for the skies so bad&hellip;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hmm, I don&rsquo;t think so. Humans don&rsquo;t fly, do they? Na√Øve one, have you ever seen a flying human? That is what they tell in their fantastic stories and fairy-tales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone poisoned my wings, my new wings!
That must be why they hurt so much&hellip; I only want the pain to stop. Nothing else is on my mind, only agony.
They&rsquo;re dying on me, I&rsquo;m leaving a trail of blood and falling feathers, wilted like leaves.
It feels like how old people describe their joint pain, as if it all were aged and worn out.
Is this, could this be, second-hand? Did someone else.. or something else bear these wings before?
Someone must&rsquo;ve been betrayed of their flight.</p>
<p>Today I will write a message to the ones rumoured of twisting flesh and bone.</p>
