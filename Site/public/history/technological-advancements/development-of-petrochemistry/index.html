<p>The book of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II_Maccabees" title="II Maccabees">II Maccabees</a> (2nd cent. BC) tells how a &ldquo;thick water&rdquo; was put on a sacrifice at the time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehemiah" title="Nehemiah">Nehemiah</a> and when the sun shone it caught fire. It adds that &ldquo;those around Nehemiah termed this &lsquo;Nephthar&rsquo;, which means Purification, but it is called Nephthaei by the many.&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naphtha#cite_note-6">6</a> This same substance is mentioned in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnah" title="Mishnah">Mishnah</a> as one of the generally permitted oils for lamps on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat" title="Shabbat">Shabbat</a>, although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi_Tarfon" title="Rabbi Tarfon">Rabbi Tarfon</a> permits only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_oil" title="Olive oil">olive oil</a> (Mishnah Shabbat 2).</p>
<p>In Ancient Greek, it was used to refer to any sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(resin)" title="Pitch (resin)">pitch</a>. The Greek word νάφθα designates one of the materials used to stoke the fiery furnace in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_the_Three_Children" title="Song of the Three Children">Song of the Three Children</a> (possibly 1st or 2nd cent. BC). The translation of Charles Brenton renders this as &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosin" title="Rosin">rosin</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The naptha of antiquity is explained to be a &ldquo;highly flammable light <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation" title="Fractionation">fraction</a> of petroleum, an extremely volatile, strong-smelling, gaseous liquid, common in oil deposits of the Near East&rdquo;; it was a chief ingredient in incendiary devices described by Latin authors of the Roman period.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naphtha#cite_note-mayor-7">7
