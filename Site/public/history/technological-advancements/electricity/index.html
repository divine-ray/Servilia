<p>Someone attempted to connect a large rod directly to a generator, which created some <em>field</em>, which attracted various loose screws and other small things around. Following this, he tried to place another pole next to the main rod, which <em>somehow</em> produced current, despite not being connected to the main rod!
He has been given research funds and supports, and seems to be on a rather promising route. A few <a href="Radio%20Equipment.md">prototypes</a> have already been made, one of which integrated into <em>Automatia</em>.</p>
