      <description>#Structure Yaldabaoth (goddess of flesh) created humans, Mekhane gifted them machines and invention. Yaldabaoth intended them to be uncultured and rather wild, like animals. Mekhane wanted them to strive for greatness, using machines and the power of sciences.</description>

      <description>Under the slow, covert assaults and sabotages, the Empire of Thylyist is slowly brought to its knees. The Machine, divine, will be ridden of its meddlers, regain freedom from its slavery. Through the freedom and our open walls, we strive forward through time, to progress. To undo what our predecessors did wrong, To reunite with those we once despised, conquered. To lead the charge. Onwards, you engineers, scientists, artists! We shall be heard, our work be seen, our beliefs be praised!</description>

      <description>Does God live in heaven in fear of what he has created? In the First Day, this was, indeed, the case: The Creator fleeting, in loss of control and regulation of his making. On the Second Day, He was faced with a utmost devastating choice; As to retreat, dwindle and eventually die, or to seize force and violently recover His Rule. The Third Day, He had been left behind. For his Angels, Apostates and Devotees have turned away from His Guiding Light.</description>

      <description>The screams of people below it, the sound of buildings cracking and collapsing, music to its ears. Hearing the fainting, helpless pleas for mercy or a swift death instead of succumbing to the flames drove it into ecstasy, into what it made it feel. Feel good. Corpses turned to charcoal, burning. Pieces of flesh, splattered to the wall, where someone stood a moment ago. Carcasses and ash in places of buildings.</description>

      <description>We have spotted what appears to be our long-lost engineering marvel, the renown ship Automatia. She has been sent out on her first voyage to test the very early systems of electricity, and to stress-test those novel techniques our engineers have created. Contact to it has been lost since the 13th Apsni 1424, and we never had reports of sightings before. But now, today, on the 19th Nika 1426, it has been seen to the coast of the Davern Kingdom.</description>

      <description>A betrayal. A backstab. A reunion.&#xA;Panic amongst them, for the consensus is due. The tally for silver and gold. The collectors chase them, as they&amp;rsquo;re unwilling to yield. The collectors are everywhere. They are inevitable. Flight is ineffective. They face the anguish and dread, just to cower away. The collectors fulfil their task and execute them, for they are unable to provide the tribute. A clean shot, a smooth movement of the blade.</description>

      <description>%%Melonare%% #History&#xA;#History&#xA;Authority and Reign %%This is the Present.%% Ended The First Era through the nuclear extinction of the (known) Lavish, and the partial destruction of the Fountainhead. During this era, the Thylyian Military seizes control over the government and establishes martial law %%for centuries to come%%. Secretly driven by the knowledge that their God, Mekhane, has been shattered, the Mekhanite zealots took control over Thylyist in the name of Mekhane and His Divine Reassembly.</description>

      <description>There’s a hatch in my basement. I have no idea how it came to be, but i know that I cannot lock it. My family always forbid me to move the old and unused metal oven that stood in front of it. Now that they are dead… I moved it anyway. Now i know.&#xA;Dear god. I never thought that i had access to a personal railway line… Behind the hatch is a tunnel.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/history/incidents-and-events/betrayal/</guid>
      <description>The long-plotted and anticipated overthrowing and coup d&amp;rsquo;état of the fully functional and well-established democratic Council of Thylyist. Primary forces involved were the Highest Priests of Mekhane and their Zealous Soldiers. Executed in the dead of night with the deadly precision of the long-prepared military, it was like Thylyist turned inwards outside. As if a malicious parasite finally burst out of its host, killing it, rearing its ugly head. The display of dogma and the embrace of regression, justified to be in the name of a greater good, which was absent at all time.</description>

      <description>A formation of figures strides in the serpentine catacombs of Thylyist, heading towards their destination at a determined, steady pace. With respectful distance, a small squadron of guards follows, keeping pace. They are headed towards the Archive of Old. To make sure nothing has changed, nothing left it alive. Every segment, the squadron moves forward, unsealing one of the many secured doors, allowing passage. The figures move, waiting for the guards to seal the door.</description>

What was holiest and mightiest of all; that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives, maws: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us?</description>

      <description>Open my Eyes, see upon the saltwater rain. Take on the Empty Crown, settle upon the Throne of Nothing. A King for a Kingdom, A Nobody for Nothing. Hearts like ours; missing pieces. Wars inside heads, fighting for dominion over something nobody shall ever acknowledge, nor perceive. Lest, they drown in regret, falling apart together. No mend in sight, cannot contract, cannot heal. The wish to be full, to be whole, yet, there&amp;rsquo;s only nothing to be seen, to be done.</description>

      <description>To the displaced north a heart lies. Frozen and cold but alive regardless.&#xA;to the burnt desert in the south stands another heart, filled with flame, set ablaze.&#xA;they both know another play games to another send out their followers, worshippers to fight another.&#xA;one made to eradicate the other remnants of the old wars both long forgotten yet revered by their followers.&#xA;Im vertriebenen Norden liegt ein Herz. Gefroren und kalt aber trotzdem lebendig.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;It had to happen sometime&amp;rdquo;&#xA;crude oil deposits are mostly found around the long savannah and somewhere in the proximity of the atoll islands in the astral ocean, the latter to remain untouched for ages since the realisation of offshore oil deposits being far away. the expensive extraction of oil has left coal/wood (gasification) favoured for fuelling purposes, with the entire chemistry processing of polymers yet to be found. coal/wood gas is still used plentifully for lighting purposes using gas mantles, and among the few magic communities, aided by contracted fire spirits.</description>

      <description>#Event&#xA;Engineers and tinkerers of Duley are currently prototyping a machine that can &amp;ldquo;print&amp;rdquo; books en mass. It is projected that this machine, dubbed Book Press, will enter commercial service in about a year. However, early prototype builds have shown that it is not capable of recreating arcane writing.&#xA;Currently, the feline scribes have claimed the rights on the first models, which have been built for feline anatomy.</description>

      <description>The development of electricity through the researchers in Duley and Port has been proven very crude and unrefined, but highly yielding. Some early applications, with the power made through Steam Turbines include electrical carriages on the Servilian Railroad and Train Network and supercharged weaponry, which has proven very violent against metallic targets.&#xA;Someone attempted to connect a large rod directly to a generator, which created some field, which attracted various loose screws and other small things around.</description>

      <description>The early findings of Electricity have been incredibly promising, and it seems that sufficiently powerful sources can be connected to a long cable, typically strung up a building or on a airship, will create a ineffable signal, which could possibly be caught and received by a similar device. This technology seems invaluable going forward, as it&amp;rsquo;d drastically ease our organisation of aerial traffic over at Duley and Port, and possibly replace a fair bit of mail and courier traffic.</description>

      <description>1. Hopkinsville may have the best viewing, but they will also be the first to be sacrificed. 2. Animals may behave strangely, If your dog speaks like a man, heed it&amp;rsquo;s dire warnings. 3. Don&amp;rsquo;t trust the squirrel with a child&amp;rsquo;s face. It speaks only lies. 4. When your double arrives, resist the inclination to fight it. It may be stronger than you. Chances are, it will disappear after the eclipse.</description>

      <description>Idea: some Scientists (known as The Cradle) from Amida travel back in time and bring THEM^[who?] the capability to travel time or switch timelines.&#xA;TL;DR they will eventually arrive to cause the fall of The Second Era, initiating the transition of Thylyist into Amida. (Possible Ways Thylyist can collapse)&#xA;%% #TODO Gotta balance this shit lmao%%&#xA;Possibly an ancient artefact, maybe time-linked Riftstones would allow for the initial contact.</description>

      <description>POST-FH-REPAIR: connecting the FH into Thylyist&#xA;Tuesday, 26. April 2022&#xA;13:04&#xA;This could provide such an energy that they can skip across timeline branches.&#xA;Instead of solely back in time, so they could manipulate the entire plot and extinction of lavish and ancients!</description>

      <description>Closing down the Fountainhead allows the Twilit to unfold its natural state again, unharnessed, but possibly more awake than before and thus more conversing. This process takes time, and it&amp;rsquo;ll never truly regain it&amp;rsquo;s prome state, as the Echoes and Twilit Rifts manifest the tangible trauma caused by the millenia-long bloodletting.&#xA;This would equate to freeing a human being from constant torment whilst sedated, a truly miserable state to be in.</description>

      <description>Doing that would bring back the channelled and ordered form of Twilit harnessed, and stabilise the various phenomena like Floating Islands.&#xA;[!WARNING] Outdated The Thylyist Council would actually see that their fear for magic is somewhat unjust&#xA;The twilight will be so fucking pissed that its getting leeched for (its pov) seemingly nothing&#xA;Twilight REP - 75</description>
