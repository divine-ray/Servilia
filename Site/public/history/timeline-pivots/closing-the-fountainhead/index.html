This process takes time, and it&rsquo;ll never truly regain it&rsquo;s prome state, as the <a href="....%5COverviews%5CConcepts%5CEchoes.md">Echoes</a> and <a href="....%5COverviews%5CConcepts%5CTwilit%20Rift.md">Twilit Rift</a>s manifest the tangible trauma caused by the millenia-long bloodletting.</p>
<p>This would equate to freeing a human being from constant torment whilst sedated, a truly miserable state to be in.</p>
<p>However, such action is not without consequences; as it is the Fountainhead that erected and stabilises the <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CHollow%20Mountains%5CHollow%20Mountains.md">Hollow Mountains</a> and <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CHollow%20Mountains%5CAncient%20Exile%5CFloating%20Islands.md">Floating Islands</a> in their current state. Such a decision would have to be made cautiously, since a hastily act would bring severe cataclysm to the lands.</p>
<p>The <a href="....%5CGroupings%5CFactions%5CAncients.md">Ancients</a> would, however, be freed, and their derivates of Nolkan apotheoitic powers would greatly benefit the general populace to cast and weave magic.</p>
