      Under the slow, covert assaults and sabotages, the Empire of Thylyist is slowly brought to its knees. The Machine, divine, will be ridden of its meddlers, regain freedom from its slavery. Through the freedom and our open walls, we strive forward through time, to progress. To undo what our predecessors did wrong, To reunite with those we once despised, conquered. To lead the charge. Onwards, you engineers, scientists, artists! We shall be heard, our work be seen, our beliefs be praised!

      Does God live in heaven in fear of what he has created? In the First Day, this was, indeed, the case: The Creator fleeting, in loss of control and regulation of his making. On the Second Day, He was faced with a utmost devastating choice; As to retreat, dwindle and eventually die, or to seize force and violently recover His Rule. The Third Day, He had been left behind. For his Angels, Apostates and Devotees have turned away from His Guiding Light.

      The screams of people below it, the sound of buildings cracking and collapsing, music to its ears. Hearing the fainting, helpless pleas for mercy or a swift death instead of succumbing to the flames drove it into ecstasy, into what it made it feel. Feel good. Corpses turned to charcoal, burning. Pieces of flesh, splattered to the wall, where someone stood a moment ago. Carcasses and ash in places of buildings.
