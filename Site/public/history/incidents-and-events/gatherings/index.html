<p>On each twelfth of a Month, Wanderers rally on a secret location that has been defined in the meeting before. Visiting these might provide valuable insights in suspected treasuries and other locations worth investigating.</p>
<p>A trade fair that is known in the entire continent, and is surely attracting plenty of visitors.
As far as I&rsquo;m aware it&rsquo;s the greatest event of it&rsquo;s kind.
The hosts spend all three moons preparing and teasing supplies to offer and sell.</p>
<p>Organised on and in proximity to the <em>Isle of Tankar</em>.</p>
