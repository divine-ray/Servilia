Retrieve the Vacuum Cleaner and Permit for a citizen
song [SAMMY J]
It was a Monday
When we took the car
And drove it to the shops-
[RANDY]
I think it was a Tuesday-
[SAMMY J]
I&rsquo;m pretty sure it wasn&rsquo;t-
No, you&rsquo;re right, it was a Tuesday
[BOTH]
Cause Derek had the permit
[RANDY]
It&rsquo;s a clear way on a Monday

<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
It was a Monday<br>
When we took the car<br>
And drove it to the shops-<br>
[RANDY]<br>
I think it was a Tuesday-<br>
[SAMMY J]<br>
I&rsquo;m pretty sure it wasn&rsquo;t-<br>
No, you&rsquo;re right, it was a Tuesday<br>
[BOTH]<br>
Cause Derek had the permit<br>
[RANDY]<br>
It&rsquo;s a clear way on a Monday<br>
[SAMMY J]<br>
Yeah, but we parked there<br>
[BOTH]<br>
So it must have been a Tuesday<br>
[SAMMY J]<br>
When we took the car-<br>
[RANDY]<br>
Did Derek give that permit back?<br>
[SAMMY J]<br>
He said he&rsquo;d leave it when he went to Queensland<br>
[RANDY]<br>
We should chase that up<br>
[SAMMY J]<br>
We will<br>
[BOTH]<br>
Still<br>
[SAMMY J]<br>
We were in the car<br>
[RANDY]<br>
Urgh&hellip;<br>
[SAMMY J]<br>
Driving to the shops-<br>
[RANDY]<br>
I&rsquo;m serious, that permit wasn&rsquo;t cheap</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
Relax, we&rsquo;ll get the permit back</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
That&rsquo;s what you said about the vacuum cleaner</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
Well that was different, he&rsquo;s got allergies</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
Like what?</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
You saw the rash!</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
It&rsquo;s eczema</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
He has to clean the carpet &lsquo;cause his cat&rsquo;s got hairy bollocks</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
He should get that thing de-sexed</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
He can&rsquo;t, he breeds them, it&rsquo;s his way of coping with a difficult divorce</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
As far as I can see his only allergy is giving back the shit he borrows from his neighbours</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
So we were driving north-</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
I mean, the guy can still afford to go to <a href="https://genius.com/22557194/Sammy-j-and-randy-good-times/Noosa">Noosa</a></p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
Yeah, what&rsquo;s your point?</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
He should just buy a vacuum cleaner</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
Look, I leant it in good faith<br>
How was I to know<br>
He&rsquo;d take it inter-state and give it to his niece for her first communion?</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
I didn&rsquo;t know he had a niece!</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
It&rsquo;s complicated, see, his sister had a friend that died<br>
She&rsquo;s barren so she felt obliged to care for her</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
So it&rsquo;s not actually his niece?</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
Well, not by blood</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
That&rsquo;s even worse, I can&rsquo;t believe he gave our vacuum cleaner to a random stranger!</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
So we were driving north-</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
South</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
South towards the-</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
North?</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
No, it was northern suburbs</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
South?</p>
<p>[BOTH]<br>
That&rsquo;s right<br>
The map was upside down, but<br>
We got there in the end</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
And parked outside the fish and chip shop</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
Fruit shop-</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
Milk bar-</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
Hardware?</p>
<p>[BOTH]<br>
Bake&ndash; no, haberdashery<br>
It&rsquo;s next door</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
To the house and home shop</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
We went in and bought a vacuum cleaner</p>
<p>[BOTH]<br>
When we came outside<br>
<a href="https://genius.com/25206686/Sammy-j-and-randy-good-times/We-had-a-parking-fine">We had a parking fine</a></p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
&lsquo;Cause Derek had the permit</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
He said he&rsquo;d give it back!</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
He didn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
Evidently!</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
I won&rsquo;t be paying that!</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
I&rsquo;m trying to tell a fuckin&rsquo; story</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
Well, tell it then</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
I will</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
Good!</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
I&rsquo;m telling it right now!</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
Oh he&rsquo;s telling it!</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
Yes I&rsquo;m trying to!</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
Well go on, tell it!</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
Fine I&rsquo;ll tell it!<br>
We were driving<br>
Home after the shops</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
But when we pulled into the driveway</p>
<p>[SAMMY J]<br>
Felt a bump</p>
<p>[RANDY]<br>
Got out</p>
<p>[BOTH]<br>
And realised we&rsquo;d run over Derek&rsquo;s cat<br>
Who was being held<br>
By Derek at the time<br>
We took the permit from his cold, dead hands and ran away<br>
Good times!</p>
