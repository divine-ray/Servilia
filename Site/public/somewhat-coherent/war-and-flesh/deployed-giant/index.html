The whistling, ear-shattering noise, then the impact.
Everyone scuttles about, as if someone prodded a stick into an anthill, looking for bodies to recover.
But there was nothing but smoulders and red smears where the shell hit.
Seconds after, the cacophony of gunfire, screams and explosions resumes.
In the distance, unnoticed so far, strides a colossus of steel, determined to change the tide of it all.
Each of its step like an earthquake, sending everyone and everything shaking.
Atop the colossus rests a cannon, shaming everything conceived before it.
It does not mind the ants in their holes; it is aiming something else.
The <em>red plague</em>, which has claimed much land and lives.
Now it has been noticed, and the frantic struggling on the battlefield ceased, both in shock and terror of the approaching beast, equal to observing a bullet speeding at my face.</p>
