Tools, created by cowards, who nudge around machinations and abominations on boards with long pointy sticks. Hidden away, alienated from the world they are destroying in the name of a higher order.
All therein remains are <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CLong%20Savannah%5CSentinel%20of%20Steel.md">rusted, decaying frames</a> of metal, impaled by deformed and twisted bones.</p>
