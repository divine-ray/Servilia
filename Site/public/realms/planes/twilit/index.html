<p>Human shared conscious divided it into seven layers, which may be traversed using protection. Attempting traversal without sufficient protection and safety will lead to a unpleasant and horrible demise.
Each layer resembles it’s previous layer, deteriorating in the process. The first layer is almost akin to our world.
Rare controversy, labelled heresy, doubted the concept of seven rigid layers, and implied a space <a href="Between.md">Between</a>.
The decay happens in a conceptual and reversing matter, that being the reduction into mere concepts and their sketches, or the return to natural shapes and materials.
At the bottom of all layers lays <a href="Dark%20Domain%5CThe%20Void.md">The Void</a>.</p>
