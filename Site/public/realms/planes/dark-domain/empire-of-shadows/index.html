<p>Elemental plane of Darkness, under the reign of Her Majesty, the <a href="......%5CBeings%5CGods%20and%20Deities%5CQueen%20of%20Shadows.md">Queen of Shadows</a>.
Part to the Darkness domain, and thus neighbouring and fading into the <a href="The%20Void.md">The Void</a> and <a href="Eternal%20Sea.md">Eternal Sea</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lighting">Lighting</h2>
<p>This plane is never lit, and sources of light are prone to consumption by the wispy shadows. Constantly shrouded in darkness, thus darksight/night vision/true sight is a necessity. Many of the local residents have developed other methods of orientation, such as echolocation or general darksight.</p>
<h2 id="topology">Topology</h2>
<p>This realm is easily divided into two sections:</p>
<h5 id="caverns">Caverns</h5>
<p>Elaborate and complex caves, carved into the very fabric of this place. It is rumoured that flux and erratic energies emerged from Limbo/Chaos to dig and erode these caverns.<br>
Some of them are chasms, sheltering entire villages of wall-dwelling creatures, and some barely allow a worm to squeeze through.
This region is home to most of the lesser shadow creatures.</p>
<h5 id="the-big-open">The Big Open</h5>
<p>A seemingly eternal plain space, devoid of any landmarks to the common, dark-seeing eye.
It is covered by a distant ceiling, which is far out of reach of any man.
Court to Her Gloom, Queen of Shadows. Her Body might be spotted, as Her Segments stretch across all of this plane.
Few Higher beings, which we classify as Beyond, reside here.</p>
