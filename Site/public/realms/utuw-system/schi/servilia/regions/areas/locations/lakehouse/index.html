<p>Built next and over to a small lake, with wooden struts and stone pillars holding the twined building stable.
It&rsquo;s build on a strong, almost untouched, nigh raw stone foundation.</p>
<p>Closer inspection reveals that every material is in a similar state to the foundation, seemingly directly put into place without further manufacturing.</p>
<p>This place is so familiar, yet feels wrong in its entirety; as if wood, rock and loam fused and grew together anew. Yet it is missing pieces: bricks gone, entire rocks missing, logs growing into trees where lumber would be.</p>
<p>This mansion or house was built long ago by now long <em>forgotten noble people</em>.
They seem to had powerful knowledge over arcane architecture, as the entire building seems to be capable of sensing its environment and inhabitants.</p>
<p>Why does it feel so familiar? Did I/we/you use to live here?
Wonâ€™t you stay here, with me, my darling?</p>
<hr>
<p>Across the sea, from over the pier reaching into the water, I spot a tall figure in a boat, seemingly adrift. They are one to carry a weighty bag, through which i spot movement. At the blink of my eyes the boat is set asunder, an i fear the well-being of this man and his ominous cargo. I long to reach to him, lest I cannot, for he is leagues away.</p>
