Almost always the bells predated woes in our lands, raids, failing harvests, famines.
What is making them ring?
One foreign traveller may find the saying &ldquo;Oh, I can hear the bells&rdquo; peculiar, yet local folks consider it impending ill-fate.
Few adventurers took it unto them as to explore the lost Clocktowers, yet none of them have been spotted alive again, their corpses to be never found. However, one letter in a bottle has been found, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Madness is the Hero&rsquo;s <em>Carnival</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of our educated literates has been able to decipher the meaning of this.</p>
