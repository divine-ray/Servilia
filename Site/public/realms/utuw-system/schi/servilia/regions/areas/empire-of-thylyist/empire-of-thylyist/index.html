<p>#Thylyist
Once the shining example of democracy, this institution has been overthrown after the <a href="..............%5CHistory%5CIncidents%20and%20Events%5CBetrayal.md">Betrayal</a>.
Ever since, the <a href="..............%5CGroupings%5CCults%20and%20Religions%5CFollowers%20of%20Mekhane.md">Followers of Mekhane</a> reign with a <a href="..............%5CGroupings%5CFactions%5CThylyian%5CGearforged%20Vanguard.md">iron fist</a>, thwarting any opposition and anything that could possibly threaten their reign.
The council of seven individuals governing the City Empire of Thylyist.
They are seen as ethereal and incorporeal from the population.
Members of the council are very rarely seen in persona and they employ life-extending technology.
Every 16 orbital periods of Heaugi (16op x 64d/op = 1024d) ,they hold a secret vote if one member has become untrustworthy and requires <em>replacements</em>.
A replacement is selected from a pool of unknowing citizens.
<a href="..............%5COverviews%5CPossible%20Ways%20Thylyist%20can%20collapse.md">But their reign is flimsy, and bound to fall and burn.</a>
They always use code names or those that don‚Äôt change.</p>

<p>It works similar to the O5 council, 7 anonymous and identity-cleansed &ldquo;immortals&rdquo; that do stuff</p>

<h2 id="thylyist-lore">Thylyist Lore</h2>
<p>In <a href="..............%5CHistory%5CEras%5CThe%20First%20Era%5CThe%20First%20Era.md">The First Era</a>, Thylyist flourished in cooperation with the Lavish and Ancients, who all coexisted peacefully.
The human society within the lesser confines of the Thylyian borders flourished and technology was easily compatible and intertwined with magic.
During the first era, the arcane conductivity of beryllium bronze was discovered, which led to its wide-employed use, which persists to the current date.
The pre-pre-predecessors of their culture and technology were actually weaving magic into their mechanisms and such, and after The Ancient Happening (TAHüòõ) the then-council banished and stigmatised any arcane doing, but the usage of beryllium bronze as main alloy remained.
‚¨ÜÔ∏èThis makes all machinery react really interesting with magic
Oi, what if the br-bronze attracts spirits and they try to ward them off?
The Ancient Happening occurred in around 1950-1970&rsquo;s of their time
Brotherhood Backstab is the entry into the Deep Archives of their doing of nuking the Lavish (Dated 1971)
The Thylyian council has fallen unknowing of their doings in the past, and thus forgot about the Fountainhead.</p>
