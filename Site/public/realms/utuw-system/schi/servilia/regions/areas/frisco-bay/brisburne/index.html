Second-largest city of <a href="..............%5CGroupings%5CFrisco%5CFrisco%20Bay%20Confederation.md">Frisco Bay Confederation</a>, and the bigger naval port and harbour than <a href="Frisco.md">Frisco</a>.
Extremely rugged and shaped by the rough sailor folks that only temporarily reside there.
An everchanging population due to being mostly, if not entirely, made up from travelling folk.</p>
<p>Despite their immense economic throughput and wealth, it appears that none of these revenues are utilised towards maintenance and expansion of the city, which leaves it to crumble. Makeshift repairs and similar crude construction work is seen everywhere, since there is no government-facilitated construction happening.
Only the fewest people here truly call Brisburne their home, since almost the entire city populace is never settling down and only there for a gig or one nightâ€™s rest and bodily pleasures.</p>
<p>The poor funding of construction and lack of proper planning led to a chaotic and mosaic-like city, with little infrastructure for recently-discovered electricity, water and sewage.
Overhangs, overpasses and similar vertical building elements are common, which makes daylight scarce in many a places. Growth of this city, despite being foul in nature, caused some harbours and shipyards to be cut off from sea access, which gave need for capable engineering in waterways and resulted in sizeable channels and tunnels running through the major segments of Brisburne.
Additionally, parts of Brisburne are built onto the sea by excessive (land)filling, and the land sections are rather swampy. This abundance of water in unwanted spaces made way for canals and channels, since fully draining and filling the sea was too costly for what little budget is available.</p>
