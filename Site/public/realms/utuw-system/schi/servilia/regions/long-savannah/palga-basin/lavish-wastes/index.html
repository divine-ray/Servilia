<p>Some Chernobyl like liquidators have set up forests of spikes around the edges of the flat, to deter people.</p>
<p>Approximately in the Centre of this giant flat is a opening, The <a href="Fountainhead.md">Fountainhead</a>.</p>
<p>The only somewhat remaining Structure is the FH </p>
<p>Basically theres nothing of value here except&hellip; nothing. All got raided over the years.</p>
<p>Except&hellip; the raw Potential of Vis that can be tapped from The Fountainhead&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they manage to actually tap it lol</p>

<p>The shit that came from the Fountainhead aided in their downfall</p>
