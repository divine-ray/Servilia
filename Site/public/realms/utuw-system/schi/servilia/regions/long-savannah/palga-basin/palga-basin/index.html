<p>The Palga Basin was a once %%during the first era%% flooded basin and primary residence to the <a href="..............%5CBeings%5CSpecies%5CLavish.md">Lavish</a> on Servilia (outside of the Sea Major). It got artificially flooded by the Lavish in the successful push to acquire ”land” and resources.</p>
<p>The basin, before it flooded, was a huge dust bowl with little life in it, most akin to a rocky desert. During the time it sheltered and housed the Lavish it was home to a flourishing and blooming oceanic ecosystem, which water drastically shaped the environment around it. The climatological impact of this flooding caused the surroundings to turn into a <a href="..............%5CWIP%20or%20Projects%5CTO-DO%5CYe'%20Good%20Olde%20TODO.md">Ye&rsquo; Good Olde TODO</a>.</p>
<p>At the violent end of the First Era, most of the water left it again, undoing its effects on the local ecosystems, turning the formerly flourishing lesser forests into mere shrubland and cold desert.
Around it&rsquo;s edge, past the Betrayal, is a singular tree still standing: the <em>Family Tree</em>.</p>
<p>The lack of water within the basin exposed their architecture to never-imagined circumstances, rendering most of their buildings and work prone to wear and scavengers, leaving only <a href="Eroded%20Frames.md">Eroded Frames</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we&rsquo;re making the assumption the mountain is massive enough to create a rain-shadow,  it&rsquo;s probably also going to have seasonal or year round snow pack and melt water to feed the basin since it&rsquo;s apparently insanely deep.
Being that close to both the mountain and ocean would probably make the climate fairly Mediterranean.
At a size that big you&rsquo;re also likely going to have some amount of wind over the lake that would make it behave more like an inland sea (waves, localize weather patterns, etc).
Something that size would also revegitate a considerable area around itself since it&rsquo;s now essentially a massive riparian zone.
If you&rsquo;re assuming the underlying material is something clastic the lake would probably do a pretty good job supporting life, presuming it&rsquo;s stocked/things upstream can travel to it and not irradiated. The water should be fairly clear and silt would settle once you&rsquo;ve established enough water volume relative to the lake capacity.
That much water is also very likely going to saturate the water table if we work under the assumption that it is indeed clastic.
That being said, you&rsquo;d probably get some crazy morphological features like caves in the surrounding area. I think the most apt descriptor for what the area would probably look like would be fairly temperate and would likely look something akin to a mixed forest in the surrounding area depending on elevation.</p>
