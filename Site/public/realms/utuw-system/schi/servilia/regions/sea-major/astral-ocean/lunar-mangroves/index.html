<p>This Mangrove forest is never seen during day. It is always obscured by a almost tangible fog during daytime, which clears at nightfall.
When it has cleared, observers on the ground witness a astonishing view to the sky, specifically the moons.</p>
<h3 id="regional-context">Regional Context</h3>
<p>The mangrove trees themselves act as tidal dampeners, to protect the <a href="....%5CNinth%20Forest%5CNinth%20Forest.md">Ninth Forest</a> and its fragile ecosystem from the erratic tides of the <a href="Astral%20Ocean.md">Astral Ocean</a>. The mangroves span a notable majority of the forest&rsquo;s coastline.</p>
<h3 id="tide">Tide</h3>
<p>During ebb (low tide), when most of the water left, the platform-like roots are revealed, which, given the nature of mangroves, present an eerie look, labyrinthine to anyone and anything unfamiliar with this exotic ecosystem.
Most of the trees grow their roots together into an entangled amalgam, which shapes a ideal habitat for lesser aquatic life that prefers the brackish water.</p>
<h3 id="lunar-phases">Lunar Phases</h3>
<p>It may appear like the entire region is dictated by <a href="........%5COpar.md">Opar</a>, along the two others. Their phases and luminosity plays a major part in the cycles and behavioural patterns of this region, since it appears barren and uninviting during daytime, and bustling with activity and the cacophony of life during night-time.
The lunar phases of Opar can be treated as elongated day-night-cycle within the region, as nocturnal critters only show activity during new moon and majorly dark phases, and vice versa with diurnal beings.
This phenomenon happens to drastically slow down metabolism and average activity, which makes this ecosystem extremely prone and vulnerable towards predators and beings that are not governed by the lunar phases.</p>
<p>Any foreign species which intrudes this area has either gone missing or got assimilated into the ecosystem, typically hue-shifting the pigmentation of the subject into a darker tone.</p>
<p>%%
#TODO:</p>
<ul>
<li>colour shift</li>
<li>Metabolism slows down anti-proportional to the phases, as a nocturnal being would hibernate/sleep</li>
<li>general adaptation and reconfiguration of physiognomy and organs
