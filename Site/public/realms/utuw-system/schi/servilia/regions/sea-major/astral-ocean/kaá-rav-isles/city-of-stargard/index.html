<p>A community of isolated and deranged sorcerers who devote their time towards the study and use of celestial bodies and formations. A decent part of their population is made from other outcasts and strangers.<br>
The only remaining actively practising guild for Astral Sorcery.
Townsfolk and activity are only seen past sundown and cease after sunrise; during the day, every citizen sleeps until nightfall. There are only few accommodations and housing-for-hire that offer a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; opening schedule for foreigners.</p>
<h3 id="location">Location</h3>
<p>Situated on the <a href="Ka%C3%A1-Rav.md">southern island</a>, peacefully coexisting with the dragons, which occasionally come to visit. Trade between the two groups is rare, but easily possible.</p>
<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
<p>The city is defined by the heavy use of marble, basalt and black granite, which has been chiselled into ornate masonry and temples around each corner. Many of the major roads and arches are embossed with <a href="................%5CItems%5CComponents,%20Ingredients%5CBar%20of%20Ithildine.md">Ithildine</a> to improve the astral channelling. Many-a-so shapes on buildings resemble symbols or other icons of extraplanetary objects like the moons, other planets, stars, and so on.</p>
<p>They value symmetry a lot, and thus, Stargard looks like a puzzle of geometric shapes when viewed aerially. However, the distinct arrangement and patterning is clearly visible once noticed.
Each temple here is dedicated towards a constellation and it&rsquo;s associated effects, and built as such.  </p>
<h2 id="residents">Residents</h2>
<p>#Lunatics #Religion</p>
<p>The deranged and off brand sorcerers residing in <a href="City%20of%20Stargard.md">Stargard</a>.
Capable of teaching the party the magic of the stars, <del>star signals</del> if they can understand them (must know ancient, celestial and draconic) and are resilient to the memetic corruption they give off.
They are rather skilled in optics, masonry and glassblowing, as their magic requires them to be.
Possibly the most &lsquo;stable&rsquo; population of gifted people, as their society is rather isolated and not too open for letting in strangers.</p>
<p>We reach for the dark seas and oceans above with our telescopes, and one day, we will sail these seas we are trapped to solely observe.
 
Some of them replaced their <a href="................%5CItems%5CWondrous%20and%20Wack%5CIron%20Oculus.md">eyes</a> with crystalline lenses or similar implants, designed to view the sky with higher quality than the ordinary eye.
Highly afraid of light, and nocturnal.
At times they scowl at the sheer mention of light.</p>
<p>They are somewhat able to predict future events by calculating celestial body alignment. Through this, they saw <em>things</em> that took most of their sanity.
They can offer valuable information if their babble and insanity can be deciphered.</p>
<h2 id="notable-locations">Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The machine for predicting, and possibly altering, orbits.
It remains unfinished, or never was finished to begin with.</p>
<p>Central to <a href="City%20of%20Stargard.md">Stargard</a>, but left tampered and dysfunctional. Its many gears whine and wail on every occasion, subject to seemingly eternal deadlock. None of the local residents have been able to understand the inner workings of this machination nor it&rsquo;s driving force, despite several associations and societies forming solely to unveil the mystique at play.
Once built by the finest Thylyian Mechanists as gift of peace, it has since been displaced to the isle of <a href="Ka%C3%A1-Rav.md">Kaá-Rav</a>, damaged in <em>the uprooting</em>.</p>
<p>As spacious as whole plaza, it remains the centrepiece to the <a href="City%20of%20Stargard.md">City of Stargard</a>, with its many hidden alleyways and paths branching off The Tellurion.<br>
Empty receptacles, like eye sockets, slot the places where each planet and moon would be.</p>
<h5 id="the-light-merchant">The Light Merchant</h5>
<p>A two-storey building of timber and brick walls, the shop of a male dwarv weapon merchant named Gastno. It is said to be built atop a crater where a piece of the sun (Utuw) fell to Schi long ago, and everything Gastno sells glows with white light for a year and a day. To reinforce the rumours, nothing around the building grows, not even the hardiest of weeds, as if the ground was completely scorched.
Unsurprisingly, he specialises in peddling wares related to light/darkness, such as blinds, candles, glowing rocks&hellip;</p>
<p>An overgrown temple ruin, which appears restored upon the night of the equinox. Various attempts at identifying the deity or alignment of this temple have been made, but all failed.</p>
<p>A ruined tower of shattered stone walls, said to be haunted by the ghost of the last empress of a long-forgotten empire. Offerings placed in the crudely-worked altar will be gone by the next full moon, but no one proofed if it actually is the bespoke ghost or just beggars.
Close to the centre of Stargard, this dome resides with a circular opening at its centre, supported by a ring of caryatid columns. The sky seen through the oculus is perpetually dark, marked by strange, foreign constellations of stars. Through intricate mechanisms, the entire dome can shift and turn, changing its viewport towards other sections of the sky. During day, the &ldquo;eyelids&rdquo;, two hemispheres, close over the dome through a unseen force.
The foundation of this dome is made from soot-covered marble, embossed with plenty of Ithildine. This embossment seems to shape some pattern towards the aperture of the dome, but they break off before touching the eyelids or &rsquo;eyeball&rsquo; itself.</p>
<p>Three arches, forming a triangle.
One from dark basalt, hot to the touch.
One from blueish ice, frozen forever.
One from white rock, pock-scarred.</p>
<p>Speculations believe that these arches are gateways made from and leading to each moon, made from their rock and mass gifted to mankind by a deity beyond.
Stepping into the space of the triangle is forbidden as it is considered sacred.
Each of these archways seem completely resilient to force, and attempting to moving them has proven futile.
Each gate fills its enclosing space with a firey/watery/dusty mist according to the lunar phases of each respective moon.</p>
