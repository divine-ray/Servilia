The main place of worship of their religion is said to be built atop a <a href="Lost%20City%20of%20the%20Ninth%20Forest.md#lich-reliquary">Lichen relic vault</a>, which has been cemented there before the <a href="How%20Dying%20ceased.md">Great Woe</a>.</p>
<p>Generally, the undying that didn&rsquo;t loose it yet are partially depressed about the seemingly inevitable decay of their kin, and therefore see the contact to the Children of the Flame as revelation/salvation, as they are capable of saving their folk, lest not willing.</p>
<p>Some of the residents are badly suffering from being <a href="............%5CBeings%5CCreatures%5CHollowed.md">Hollowed</a>. Residents suffering from hollowing are still treated with respect and care, similar to Alzheimer or dementia patients IRL.</p>

<h5 id="sinners">&lsquo;Sinners&rsquo;</h5>
<p>A brighter faction of them are using their pseudo-eternal life to do what they never could&rsquo;ve done, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bodily pleasures</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sex, drugs, rock and roll&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;sinful&rdquo; activities
However, this particular kind falls easily for hubris and is commonly detained (as those fall for hollowing quick).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="artisan-work-and-research">Artisan work and Research</h4>
<p>Vastly more common than those &lsquo;sinful&rsquo; people are those that dedicate their seemingly-eternal life towards craftsmanship, wizardry and research, which has earned Sepulchre as a whole a status of small, but highly renown expertise.
The scientists of <a href="..%5CAreas%5CFrisco%20Bay%5CDuley%20and%20Port.md">Duley and Port</a> and Sepulchre are in close-knit contact, driving innovation.</p>
<p>A rouge splinter group of Dwarves has settled within the laboratories of Sepulchre, supplying them with materials and their bodies for study.</p>
