 These peaks seem to be haunted by poltergeists and memetic nightmares, but only during night. This may be a influence from the deviated sea. An above average occurrence of night runners have been <code>spotted</code> <del>here</del>&hellip;
 
Almost identical to the surface traits of the Hollow Mountains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infested with night Runners</li>
<li>Multitude of sharp mountain peaks</li>
<li>Related to a supernatural being.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the <a href="............%5CBeings%5CCreatures%5CNight%20Runner.md">Night Runner</a> presence looms much stronger here, as no other force is governing them here.</p>
<p>They even seem to <em>seep</em> through the rock and stone&hellip; It cannot be healthy to stay here for longer..
Their strong presence here haunts any unsuspecting traveller, especially in their dreams.</p>
