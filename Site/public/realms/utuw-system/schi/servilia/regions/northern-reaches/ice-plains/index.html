<p>Nothing but blinding, glaring white in sight.
This is hell, frozen over. It still wants you dead, at every step you take.</p>
<p>There, there is the wall. The stockades, raised to protect It.
Stone, taken from mountains, stolen from riverbeds, entrenched into plastered growths of ice and mineral.
It lives its solitude, for intruders, <em>like <strong>you</strong></em>, are not desired.
They are merely feed, fodder.</p>
<p>It would be naive for you to attempt to escape It, yet you tried. Brought your shovel, your tools. That what otherwise is your only means to live is ridiculed by the snow, by the sheer masses of snow falling unto you.
Yet, you keep on trying. Humans, aren&rsquo;t they peculiar?
They try to achieve something in their feeble life, knowing it&rsquo;ll kill them.
And they&rsquo;re proud.
&hellip;
You struck Ice.
Below the metre-thick layer of snow, like fur, lies ice.
You can see so clearly, see every vein throbbing, pulsing, as the foul blood runs through the roots of this impious creation.
At the sway of your head, you see the colours. All the colours. Every single aurora here, trapped, ensnared in the ice, shimmering, as if it were fog to a clear midsummernight, clouds to the night sky.
But this, this defies any of nature&rsquo;s grace and beauty, for it is a mere parody of nature&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>This seems to have a reason.</p>
<p>The Heart of cold is in this area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tainted veins burrowed themselves into Mother Gaia&rsquo;s flesh.</p>
<p>Leeching off warmth.</p>
<p>Causing all life to perish. Bringing cold. Bringing Death.</p>
<p>Yet&hellip; It lives. Brings its own life.</p>
<p> 
These ice plains are constantly exposed to heavy storms and snowfall, which makes it a environment hazardous to any conventional life form.</p>
<p>A thick wall or fortification from rock, cliffs and ice looms around this slightly elevated area, fortifying it in addition to the the danger posed by glacial time.</p>
