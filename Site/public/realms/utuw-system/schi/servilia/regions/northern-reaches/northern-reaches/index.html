<p>This region is heavily influenced by the now-dead volcanism and the everlasting cold.</p>
<p>Most significant are towering <a href="Alp%20Peaks.md">Alp Peaks</a>, which add the unique climatic aspect by blocking off winds from the sea, a distant and deviated arm of the Astral Ocean.</p>
<p>These peaks seem to be haunted by poltergeists and memetic nightmares, but only during night. This may be a influence from the deviated sea. An above average occurrence of night runners have been spotted here¿¡</p>
<p>A similarly weird area origins from those peaks, being the <a href="Eternal%20Glacier.md">Eternal Glacier</a>. This glacier poses a temporal anomaly, as anything within its area appears frozen to outside observers. Still, being a glacier, it grinds down its way, eventually into the ocean, where the anomalous effects begin to fade and eventually cease.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a colossal spire of the hardest rock splits some arm or branch of the glacier, which shapes a massive <em>Icy Plains</em>, which isn&rsquo;t subjected to the glacial movement.</p>
