All of them are alone, yet none of them seek company through their siblings.
Forced to helplessly watch upon the abuse, torment and wounding of their Mother&rsquo;s body, yet corpse as Man keeps spreading their Ideals, their Greater Good, tolling <a href="The%20Utuw%20Family.md">The Utuw Family</a>, making them suffer for their loss.
