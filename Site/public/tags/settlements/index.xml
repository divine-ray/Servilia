      <description>Overview A community of isolated and deranged sorcerers who devote their time towards the study and use of celestial bodies and formations. A decent part of their population is made from other outcasts and strangers.&#xA;The only remaining actively practising guild for Astral Sorcery. Townsfolk and activity are only seen past sundown and cease after sunrise; during the day, every citizen sleeps until nightfall. There are only few accommodations and housing-for-hire that offer a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; opening schedule for foreigners.</description>
