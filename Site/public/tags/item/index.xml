      <description>From Latin “Inanis” = nothing (adj.) A metal, pitch black, deeper and darker than the night and the deepest depths of the sea. It seems to be convulsing, yes, shaking. Bringing light to it seems feeble, as no torch, no candle known to us can combat the darkness it radiates. Shadows seem to grow longer and act strangely in proximity to a bar of this. What as this? Is this what pure darkness looks like, instilled upon metal?</description>

      <description>This sturdy wooden cart is supported by four over-sized treadwheels, each of which contains a magical rat. The cart can carry up to 2000 pounds of weight, and balances itself. It moves at a speed of 40 ft. for up to eight hours per day, but never between midnight to dawn. The cart follows your simple verbal commands to start, stop, turn, etc. Each rat may be fed1 daily for a hour of extra performance.</description>

      <description>God&amp;rsquo;s own telephone. As the saying goes, modern problems require modern solutions.&#xA;It has access to the heavenly bureaucracy and banishment of hell, effectively enabling the wielder to condemn or bring salvation to any soul at will. Allows the user to dial to any other celestial beings, including the old gods.&#xA;Made from a ethereal crystalline lattice, which has captured all kinds of electromagnetic radiation throughout the time, making it incredibly dangerous for any mortal to hold due to suspending several gigasivert of ionising radiation.</description>
