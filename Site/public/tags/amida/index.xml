      <description>They&amp;rsquo;ll see that the Machine will betray them, rust, fall apart. The True Machinists were mistaken; His Design is flawed. They will turn to the silicon, to what makes computers: Holy Code. They will try to strip their physical body, become one with the Runtime. Each will become the very first Numerator, entrapped in steel, silicon and misshapen flesh, but promised to exist forevermore. There will be no flaws, for The Debugger is flawless.</description>
