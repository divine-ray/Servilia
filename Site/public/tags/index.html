Engineers and tinkerers of Duley are currently prototyping a machine that can &ldquo;print&rdquo; books en mass.

      #Structure Yaldabaoth (goddess of flesh) created humans, Mekhane gifted them machines and invention. Yaldabaoth intended them to be uncultured and rather wild, like animals. Mekhane wanted them to strive for greatness, using machines and the power of sciences.
This led to a severe conflict, arms race and eventual escalation in global war between the both factions, devastating humanity as a whole in the events of the Nølkā-Mekhanite War (save for those species who were above human clashing).

      Overview This Mangrove forest is never seen during day. It is always obscured by a almost tangible fog during daytime, which clears at nightfall. When it has cleared, observers on the ground witness a astonishing view to the sky, specifically the moons.
Regional Context The mangrove trees themselves act as tidal dampeners, to protect the Ninth Forest and its fragile ecosystem from the erratic tides of the Astral Ocean. The mangroves span a notable majority of the forest&rsquo;s coastline.

      Empire of Thylyist Former city-state, grown to the size of a empire. The City of Thylyist is their capital, and epicentre of their official religion, the Followers of Mekhane, originally conceived as bunker-fort installation shortly before the end of the Nølkā-Mekhanite War. Their government is practically defunct. Instead, the religious elite (Council of Thylyist), and to a extend, the Gearforged Vanguard is de-facto ruling. The fanatical devotion impacts everyday life and has frozen technological and scientific progress, leaving them stuck in early steam-driven technology.

      This sturdy wooden cart is supported by four over-sized treadwheels, each of which contains a magical rat. The cart can carry up to 2000 pounds of weight, and balances itself. It moves at a speed of 40 ft. for up to eight hours per day, but never between midnight to dawn. The cart follows your simple verbal commands to start, stop, turn, etc. Each rat may be fed1 daily for a hour of extra performance.

      Pillars of steel, concrete and mystery, reaching into the foul sky. Monoliths, each bigger than you can perceive and understand. Surrounded by the harsh, chemical stench of a industrial complex, you stand in front of a gap, only held back by a flimsy, rusted railing. The abyss calls for you, the railing is weak. Lost you are, stuck in paralysis, unable to decide or act. Is it really worth it, living, slaving away, at the promise of eventual relief that you know you&rsquo;ll never reach?

something about a metaphorical window representing the peephole of the soul to the world, which could be broken somehow (possible metaphor for transcendence)
Each soul is only a visitor from A Realm Beyond, only tied into the mortal shell. Souls without any coherence and such enter a state of degenerate matter, known as Amarisk or Spirits. Exposure to too much entropy and chaos can deteriorate souls, deform them until they cannot reside in a physical body anymore, but need special procedures (Birth of Energy) to be materialised.

Intelligence Classifications The Intelligence piloting a mobile combat unit is classified under three categories:
Autonomous Fully independent cognition, capable of reasoning and own actions. Restricted Limited cognition, able to execute complex tasks but not capable of improvising. Hybrid A subclass of 1. Autonomous, these systems are oriented around providing assistance to a humanoid pilot, but can steer the unit with little flexibility on its own. Blind, Deaf, Dumb (BDD) Barely considered intelligent, these units fully require a pilot to function.
