      <description>From Latin “Inanis” = nothing (adj.) A metal, pitch black, deeper and darker than the night and the deepest depths of the sea. It seems to be convulsing, yes, shaking. Bringing light to it seems feeble, as no torch, no candle known to us can combat the darkness it radiates. Shadows seem to grow longer and act strangely in proximity to a bar of this. What as this? Is this what pure darkness looks like, instilled upon metal?</description>
