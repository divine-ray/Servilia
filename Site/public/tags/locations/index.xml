      <description>During The First Era: A flourishing and thriving city, dedicated towards research and trade. A joint effort and collaboration between the Lavish, Dragonkin and Humanity gave way for a ultimate creation: a draconic-blooded humanoid, augmented with Pseudoneo biotechnology, who have dubbed themselves Varu√∫. This city was the one to be gifted the first Argrosy station, which remains functional. Given the diverse cultural mix present, it is considered necessary to go vertical, both into the ground and into the skies, to accommodate all residents.</description>

When it has cleared, observers on the ground witness a astonishing view to the sky, specifically the moons.&#xA;Regional Context The mangrove trees themselves act as tidal dampeners, to protect the Ninth Forest and its fragile ecosystem from the erratic tides of the Astral Ocean. The mangroves span a notable majority of the forest&amp;rsquo;s coastline.</description>
