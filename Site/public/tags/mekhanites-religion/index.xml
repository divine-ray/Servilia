      <description>A large sphere of rotating gears and ticking escapements, crafted from brass and inscribed with glowing runes. No-one seems to know who created it, nor when, nor its purpose.&#xA;No tangible power source of this object is visible, and any kind of studies are met with highest force from the Followers of Mekhane as solely viewing it is considered heresy.&#xA;High Constructors believe that this piece is the heart of their torn apart god, the Blessed Machine Mekhane.</description>
