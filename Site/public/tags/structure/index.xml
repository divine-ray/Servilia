      <description>Strands of energies, stretching across space and time. Like strings pinned down, they tangle up and straighten again. One of the many shapes of Amarisk- yet not woven of Twilit. Unique in their own ways, these threads connect places and planets. Soaring heights and hills cause ties and tangle, plains soothe the weave.</description>

      <description>Empire of Thylyist Former city-state, grown to the size of a empire. The City of Thylyist is their capital, and epicentre of their official religion, the Followers of Mekhane, originally conceived as bunker-fort installation shortly before the end of the Nølkā-Mekhanite War. Their government is practically defunct. Instead, the religious elite (Council of Thylyist), and to a extend, the Gearforged Vanguard is de-facto ruling. The fanatical devotion impacts everyday life and has frozen technological and scientific progress, leaving them stuck in early steam-driven technology.</description>

      <description>A comprehensive summary of Cults, Organised Religions and other followings present in Servilia. Loosely sorted by impact and known member count.&#xA;Followers of Mekhane One of the two big religions ever formed in Servilia, this religion descended from the remnants of their once-great Mekhanite religion. Originally created as direct worshippers of Mekhanes will at the conception of Mankind, now turned into a lesser, deviated hodgepodge, in which their highest ranks assume the positions of dictatorship.</description>
