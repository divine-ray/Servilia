      <description>The Blessed Machine, shattered and rent apart in The War. His Pieces, scattered. His Followers, given one task: His Divine Reassembly. Upon the day of His Reassembly, Reckoning shall be brought down upon The False, the fools and the pretentious.&#xA;He who is Perfection, driven to augment Himself until Apotheosis, whom He has achieved. Design given Power, Power given Mass: From Nothing Comes His Ways. Mekhane; He who created Himself and brought forth Creation as Whole.</description>

      <description>The Mekhanites are the monotheistic religion which worship the Heart of Mekhane and itâ€™s Ideal Design of Gear, Steel and Steam. They are the leading and ruling class of Empire of Thylyist, self-entitled to reign, with no restraints to use force through the Gearforged Vanguard. As of the present, their proxy figures in the Council of Thylyist has led to a authoritarian regime in which progress, may it be scientific, economic or cultural, is condemned and free thought considered unlawful and valid grounds for execution or expulsion.</description>

      <description>A large sphere of rotating gears and ticking escapements, crafted from brass and inscribed with glowing runes. No-one seems to know who created it, nor when, nor its purpose.&#xA;No tangible power source of this object is visible, and any kind of studies are met with highest force from the Followers of Mekhane as solely viewing it is considered heresy.&#xA;High Constructors believe that this piece is the heart of their torn apart god, the Blessed Machine Mekhane.</description>
