      <description>Overview This Mangrove forest is never seen during day. It is always obscured by a almost tangible fog during daytime, which clears at nightfall. When it has cleared, observers on the ground witness a astonishing view to the sky, specifically the moons.&#xA;Regional Context The mangrove trees themselves act as tidal dampeners, to protect the Ninth Forest and its fragile ecosystem from the erratic tides of the Astral Ocean. The mangroves span a notable majority of the forest&amp;rsquo;s coastline.</description>
