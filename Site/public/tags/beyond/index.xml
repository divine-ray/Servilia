      <description>The Blessed Machine, shattered and rent apart in The War. His Pieces, scattered. His Followers, given one task: His Divine Reassembly. Upon the day of His Reassembly, Reckoning shall be brought down upon The False, the fools and the pretentious.&#xA;He who is Perfection, driven to augment Himself until Apotheosis, whom He has achieved. Design given Power, Power given Mass: From Nothing Comes His Ways. Mekhane; He who created Himself and brought forth Creation as Whole.</description>

      <description>God&amp;rsquo;s own telephone. As the saying goes, modern problems require modern solutions.&#xA;It has access to the heavenly bureaucracy and banishment of hell, effectively enabling the wielder to condemn or bring salvation to any soul at will. Allows the user to dial to any other celestial beings, including the old gods.&#xA;Made from a ethereal crystalline lattice, which has captured all kinds of electromagnetic radiation throughout the time, making it incredibly dangerous for any mortal to hold due to suspending several gigasivert of ionising radiation.</description>
