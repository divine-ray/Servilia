Capable of teaching the party the magic of the stars, star signals if they can understand them (must know ancient, celestial and draconic) and are resilient to the memetic corruption they give off. They are rather skilled in optics, masonry and glassblowing, as their magic requires them to be. Possibly the most &lsquo;stable&rsquo; population of gifted people, as their society is rather isolated and not too open for letting in strangers.

They operate in high stealth and secrecy.
Enduring the cruel path of becoming hollow and converting to a vessel is their most valued act, and is only reserved to those whom are deemed worthy.
