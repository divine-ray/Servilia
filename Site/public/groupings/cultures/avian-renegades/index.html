<p>A loose group of first-generation songbirds, who broke their shackles (both metaphorically and physically) from the Lavish.
Seen more times than not around the <a href="..%5CDwarves.md">Dwarves</a>, as they source their parts from the dwarven machinations.
They&rsquo;re the only known songbirds that can reproduce solely by themselves.
Ancestors to the <a href="..%5CFactions%5CEmpire%20of%20Winds.md">Empire of Winds</a>, as they are built tough and enduring.
The main &rsquo;tribe&rsquo; is only found occasionally, as they live a nomadic life around Servilia. Despite that, they still allow themselves to get hired for a pretty penny- er, commodity, since they do not understand currency.</p>
