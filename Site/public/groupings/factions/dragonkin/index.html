<p>Few exceptions in violent chromatic dragons who wage conquest and war for their own benefit and riches.
These few outliers shape the negative image of all dragonkin, resulting in many &ldquo;Kill on Sight&rdquo; orders
Dragonkin is subjected to genocide attempts by the <a href="Thylyian%5CCouncil%20of%20Thylyist.md">Council of Thylyist</a> and it&rsquo;s military.
The attackers have been horribly defeated repeatedly.<br>
Yet they keep on trying.</p>
