The descendants of the long-gone <em>Nølkā</em>, now accustomed to their involuntary <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CHollow%20Mountains%5CAncient%20Exile.md">Ancient Exile</a>, after suffering ground-shattering defeats following the <em>Nølkā-Mekhanite War</em>.
Their Humanity long gone; abandoned in favour of perfection and strive for power amongst their own ranks, brewing and scheming their stealthy return.
Their society resembles a closed-down ethnostate, hostile towards those who express any intent to join their ranks.
Commonly dubbed the New Gods, for the <em>Nølkā</em> <a href="Theophagy.md">killed, devoured</a> and effectively replaced the long-established <a href="....%5COverviews%5CSummaries%5CUniversal%20Pantheon.md">Universal Pantheon</a>. Despite this title, no group is officially worshipping and revering to them, as their rise to power is seen as foul and cheated on.</p>
<p>No resident there has been born with these powers; each has <a href="Apotheosis.md">taken the greatest sacrifice</a> to achieve their powers.
Possibly the ethnic group with the best twilit conductance, as they have been practising eugenics and breeding for it since ages.</p>
<p>Possibly all retired lvl 20 adventurers ascend into their circles.</p>
<p>Gradam Cant is their form of catalysing raw Amarisk into working.
(Lit. Ancient Language)</p>
<p>They have a approx 0.25x scaling on reputation gain.</p>
