<p>Early attempts at electric trains using overhead conductors are in experimental phases around Frisco. So far, it has not proven profitable and needs refinement.</p>
<p>Major stations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frisco</li>
<li><a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CAreas%5CFrisco%20Bay%5CBrisburne.md">Brisburne</a></li>

%%Descent of second era: A station for Anor is planned, but negotiations with the Dwarves are ongoing.%%</li>
