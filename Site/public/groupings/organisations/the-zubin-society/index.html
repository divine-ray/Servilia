Their drug is special, since everyone who consumes it shares all hallucinations with the rest of the society.
The whereabouts of the drug or their leader is unknown, but he is revered as their Messiah, who allowed them to break free from their simple mind.
United in their consumption and mourning of the absence of their Messiah, they strive for full dissociation of the mind from its mortal shell in pursuit of perpetual ecstasy and insights into the cosmos.
They have possibly faced horrors beyond comprehension and suffered severe psychosis and insanity, which they compensate with even more sedatives.</p>
<p>Those few who conversed with them have reported that they&rsquo;re able to talk to some <a href="....%5CRealms%5CPlanes%5CTwilit.md">higher entity</a> or even <em>speak with the dreams</em>, which has <em>left any listener unsettled and terrified</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>What we must achieve is;<br>
Liberation from perception, the binary concepts of truth and wrong, good or bad.
Shed the restraints of our feeble mind, who oh so gladly keeps itself tied up, lulled in noise and distraction.
We want to see, sense that what we never were meant to comprehend, to reach.<br>
Someone out there is playing tricks on us, and they are having their mighty fun using all of humanity as playthings.</p>
