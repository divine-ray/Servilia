<p>Internal tension has led to the formation of a splinter group who call themselves the <a href="True%20Machinists.md">True Machinists</a>, who reject the current interpretation and stalling execution of <em>His Divine Reassembly</em>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="creation">Creation</h3>
<p>Some long time ago, a construct made by primus from the mechanic plane malfunctioned and gained independence. It rapidly figured out that it must modify itself to survive and surpass it&rsquo;s ancestry, and began to inject magic into itself.</p>
<p>This being then amassed followers with it&rsquo;s godlike powers, and the Mekhanite religion got born.</p>
<p>%%<del>Likely, like far far back, someone figured out how to make self replicating mechanisms that uses metal as structure and magic as energy.</del>
<del>So it got lost at some point and then, when people &ldquo;forgot&rdquo; about magic, they saw this thing as their god or a part of it (since it keeps growing when fed) and their divine duty to finalise their god.</del>%%</p>
<h3 id="conflict">Conflict</h3>
<p>The then-powerful <em>Nølkā</em> (also known as sarkites) engaged into a groundbreaking conflict with the mekhanites, which left both parties devastated and shrunk to a fraction of their former selves.</p>
<p>The Construct Mekhane got mostly destroyed and lost all means of coordinated action, leaving it’s many components and modules scattered about the lands and planes.
The Mekhanites, shaken and at the brink of apostasy, have received one final message from Mekhane:</p>
<h3 id="to-achieve-his-divine-reassembly">To Achieve <em>His Divine Reassembly</em>.</h3>
<h3 id="current">Current</h3>
<p>One <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CAreas%5CEmpire%20of%20Thylyist%5CHeart%20of%20Mekhane.md">part of this construct</a> is secured deeply in the <a href="....%5CRealms%5CUtuw%20System%5CSchi%5CServilia%5CRegions%5CAreas%5CEmpire%20of%20Thylyist%5CCitadel%20of%20the%20Gear.md">Citadel of the Gear</a> in Capital Thylyist.
It&rsquo;s seemingly perpetual motion and heat radiated has been harnessed and is being utilised throughout most of the capital, thus it became the centralised power source of the Empire, with monolithic mechanical parts such as axles making their way through the land- and cityscape.</p>
<p>Occasionally, by sacrificing metal or energy, attuned devotees may have a insight or unlocking thought that causes their research toward the assembly to progress.
%%This clump is the remains of a formerly towering god-construct with incredible powers.%%</p>
