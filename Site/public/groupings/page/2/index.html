In the subterranean ecosystem of the mountains, the Dwarves are rather high up, yet not the Apex Predator in the food chain, which led them to develop and create metallic body plating and amour, embedded and embossed onto their very bodies.
They&rsquo;re responsible for the rising instability of the mountains as they&rsquo;re only held up by the dwindling power of the fountainhead and rotting supports.

A anarchic tribal cluster of winged, sentient beings, residing in the Northern Reaches and the Crevice Canyons. Certainly distinct from Songbirds and self-distinguished from the Avian Renegades, these creatures adapted and modified themselves towards ideal lethality and efficiency. Once within the families of songbirds, these extremes-seeking outcasts changed and turned themselves towards the harsh, brutish wilderness.
They&rsquo;ve made themselves into extremely agile hunters, and are cultured as such. Due to the nature of their home, they&rsquo;re virtually unable to leave their territories due to perfect adaptation to their realm.

      Profile: #Lavish This water-bound species shaped the once-dry Palga Basin into a massive body of water, sustaining their life. Settled within Syksa, Lavish Capital.
Decscription of the Species: Lavish were sentient and crafty descendants of molluscs (squid, octopi) that called highly oxygenated, clear waters their home. They primarily fed on aquatic microorganisms (&lt;1cm) and rarely off black smoker ecosystems. Through the superior dexterity gained by their tentacles, this species has mastered both magic and conventional technology and was capable of fusing those into artificial life.
