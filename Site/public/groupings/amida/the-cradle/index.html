<p>The Cradle is a decently sized group of researchers specialised in temporal studies, part of <em>adAstra SocInstitute</em>.
Recent results of their studies have revealed that the timeline of <a href="..%5CAmida.md">Amida</a> will experience termination and dissonance if not for the <em>collapse of the Thylyian Empire</em>.
#TODO
Instabilities in the rehabilitated, healing twilit “delivered“ documents and snippets of other timelines, in which Amida was wnever founded and Thylyist still stands, albeit in a possibly different state.
In secret, the cradle has been given broad funding by the <a href="Board%20of%20Amida-Seven.md">Board</a> to guarantee the continued existence of their timeline.
<em>Project Silverspoon</em> has begun and a truce for dominion between the corporations has temporarily been established to ensure collaboration towards a mutually profitable goal.</p>
<p>The “Cats”, as the members of the cradle, are called (partially literal due to anthropomorphs and cyberware), are trying to send information back in time to a easily manipulable group to initiate butterfly effects.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do they give the engineers of Thylyist blueprints for time machines or do they actually travel to our time themselves?</p>
