Blatant self insert.

Depressive deity that made the world, but sold it to some unrelated entity.

Their depression allowed for the plague that we call the [Curse of the Undead](..\..\..\Overviews\Concepts\Curse%20of%20the%20Undead.md).

Often seen as careless by the other pulastaya, but not out of malicious intent but rather disregard and lack of a healthy relation and position.
