The soul- and mindless poppets of [The Void](..\..\Realms\Planes\Dark%20Domain\The%20Void.md). 
Carved out hollows, stripped of humanity through masks and rags, thrown into the pit to be filled with sheer nothing. 
Created by outfitting a fully [Hollowed](..\Creatures\Hollowed.md) individual with a [Vessel Mask](..\..\Items\Artifacts\Vessel%20Mask.md), optionally rags, and extreme exposure to Void. 
Vessels are "made" by throwing a masked hollow into [The Abyss](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Long%20Savannah\Palga%20Basin\The%20Abyss.md), which eventually makes them fall into the void. 
However, the void will return the vessel if somehow under full control.
