*Not to be confused with a [Corse](..\..\Overviews\Concepts\Corse.md), the animate remains of a Deity.*
Before [Dying ceased](..\..\WIP%20or%20Projects\TO-DO\How%20Dying%20ceased.md), Arch-mages and other arcane-affiliated people which wanted to live forever sacrificed their humanity and personality, turning their body into a husk that thrives on sacrificed Amarisk. 
This practice was frowned and looked-down upon by the majority of other arcane folk, but those that survived the procedure were usually accepted (and respected for their survival). 

### Creation of a Lich

The ritual of creating or transforming into a lich involves isolating the local fabric trough which would escape, and deliberately killing the subject, which forces the soul out of the body. 
To disrupt the local fabric and Twilit, 
But through the disrupting the local fabric, it cannot get ferried into the *Afterlives*, and therefore must be captured in a vessel, which will become the Lich, with all the memories of the former person.
The vessel must be prepared beforehand, and is commonly a animated corpse or construct, both of which cases require tremendous effort and expertise to succeed. 
Secondary to the procedure is creating a container which acts as backup copy of the soul, which can store enough Amarisk to recreate/mend the vessel in case of injuries. Said container is usually a urn, but any watertight container suffices. However, it must be able to contain the soul within, which is typically done by cladding the inside with arcanophobe materials like silver, which gets engraved with runes and other words of banishment and containment. Antimemetic seals and such might've been used as well. 

### Sepulchre

Remains of defeated/deceased[^1] have been buried and cemented underneath Tombstone, in the Necropolis Sepulchre, dug specifically for this purpose (back then). 

### End of First Era

On the end of the First Era, with the collapse of the Fountainhead and thus the seemingly infinite supply of twilight [Amarisk](..\..\Overviews\Concepts\Magic%20System\Amarisk.md), most Liches existing turned into the vicious and destructive necromantic warlords as they are known today. 
However, many got neutralised or placed into Amarisk starvation within the chaos after [The First Era](..\..\History\Eras\The%20First%20Era\The%20First%20Era.md). 
Few remain conscious and within reason, attempting to unravel historyand fulfil the [Major Plotlines > Great Amnesty](..\..\Overviews\Summaries\Major%20Plotlines.md#great-amnesty).

after the fall of the lavish, they lost their shits and turned into the necromantic warlords as which we know them today. only few specimens remain active however, as many got eliminated in the looming chaos between the eras.
