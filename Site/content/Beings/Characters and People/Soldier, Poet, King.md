A trio of legendary adventurers who haven't been condemned to the Ancient Exile.

Motives unknown, but rather present in folklore and song.

Despite the telltales saying them to be dead or missing, they're still active and out there.

Their trio is welded together shut, working flawlessly together, said to be able to overcome any obstacle. 

Soldier: 
"There will come a soldier  
Who carries a mighty sword  
He will tear your city down"

Poet:
"there will be a poet 
who's weapon is his word 
he will slay you with his tongue"

King: 
"There will come a ruler 
Whose brow is laid in thorn  
Smeared with oil like David's boy"
