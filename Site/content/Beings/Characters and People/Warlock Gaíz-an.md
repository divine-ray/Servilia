\#Characters 
Prophet of Absence, Founder of the [Oblivion Lodge](..\..\Groupings\Cults%20and%20Religions\Oblivion%20Lodge.md), he who will tear down the walls in our hearts, allowing [it](..\..\Realms\Planes\Dark%20Domain\The%20Void.md) to come. 

They have stolen knowledge about the Limbo Boneyard, and embarked on their quest to return the masks to the void.
Their first sacrifice to the void was their gender, they are now a-gender.

They lived long enough in the proximity of the fountainhead to be highly deranged and insane, and believes that the void is right in its motive to annihilate the material plane.
