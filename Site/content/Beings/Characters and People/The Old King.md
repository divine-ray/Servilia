The skeletal remains of The Former [Davern](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Areas\Davern%20Kingdom\Davern%20Kingdom.md) King bound under the fort-castle of *Auvergne*.

He remains aware, having to look at the world from below.
He was the first king to sit atop the *throne of ascension*, and the last to be granted divine reason by it. In the end, everything eventually demands, and forcibly takes, its toll. 

Revered to as God by the citizens and people of Davern, yet He has been forgotten if not for folk and rumours. Regardless, as if for spite, his bones and flesh, torn apart from another, exist onwards. 
Both knowing they'll never be, never see, never know. What was whole once will not be true again. 
The flesh, locked in a coffin, mummified, yet refusing to decay.
His deceased, desecrated flesh remains wrapped in his mighty golden-yellow garb and robe, whom vermin reduced to scraps.
The bones, restrained onto the Throne, inanimate, yet full of spirit. 
Forever they must atone for their sins, united in suffering, separated in physios. 
Sharing a *fate...*

Known as King Erl, Earlking or other permutations during his reign, in which he raised [Davern](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Areas\Davern%20Kingdom\Davern%20Kingdom.md) to it's current state of greatness.
