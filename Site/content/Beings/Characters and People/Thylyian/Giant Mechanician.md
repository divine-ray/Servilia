\#Thylyist 

%%Sells all kinds of mechanical components and such%%
Prisoner of *War*, former Nolkan creation, held captive for its incredible strength.
Forced to slave away as a living forge hammer, this unfortunate existence only wishes for death.

Hidden deep underground. 

Incapable of detailed speech, mumbles all the time

Mechanically augmented
