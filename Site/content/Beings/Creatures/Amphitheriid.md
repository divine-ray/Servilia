I first spotted this dignified creature in what i thought to be a gust of wind. After some rest, I managed to get a sight on a distant individual, from which I have been blown away by the splendour of colours and almost divine curves. 
They are serpents, given colourful feathered wings, and bearing a maw akin to a beak.

When I tried to approach their gathering of three, all of them quickly slithered away, and took to the skies in a single, smooth motion.
