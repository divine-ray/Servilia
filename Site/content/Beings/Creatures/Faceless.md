A curse or other [misfortune](..\..\History\Eras\The%20Second%20Era\Fall.md) has driven these poor *people* insane, yet not letting them die.
Possibly hollow or undead people which have lost all mental integrity.

Upon careful inspection, you recognise their catastrophically degraded mental condition.

Maybe you can try to help these lost fellows?

Their facial features are all destroyed, covered below horrible scars, seem to shape eerie patterns. You have a uneasy feeling trying to make out what these patterns mean. That shadow just moved, didn't it?
These scars likely come from self-imposed injuries from their uncut nails, which would place a dragon in envy. 
In fact, their entire body appears to be mistreated and neglected, starved to the bone, uncut hair... but... They seem to remember to wash themselves. Odd.

 > Their faces are covered in long and poorly-healed scars, likely sourcing from scratching themselves with their horribly elongated nails that resemble talons or claws.
 > Their hair is also extremely mistreated, as with the rest of their body. 

Answering them with sung Gradam Cant is likely (1d100,x\>40) going to calm them, and some lore will be revealed.

Singing to them with [Marilee, the Songstress](..\Characters%20and%20People\Exiled\Marilee,%20the%20Songstress.md)' blessing will ease their mind and they can be communicated with using nonverbal means (as their mouth and ways of vocalisation are ruined).

(Their mental state is still pretty broken, and on the development of a toddler, 3yo.)

### Chanting

They can be heard chanting this in a sobbing and deranged manner, as long as they don't perceive someone else:

 > 
 > I am tired of punching in the wind  
 > I am tired of letting it all in  
 > And I should eat you up and spit you right out  
 > I should not care but I don't know how
 > 
 > So I take off my face  
 > Because it reminds me of how it all went wrong  
 > And I pull out my tongue  
 > Because it reminds me of how it all went wrong
 > 
 > I am sorry for the trouble, I suppose  
 > My blood runs red but my body feels so cold  
 > I guess I could swim for days in the salty sea  
 > But in the end the waves will discolour me
 > 
 > So I take off my face  
 > Because it reminds me of how it all went wrong  
 > And I pull out my tongue  
 > Because it reminds me of how it all went wrong  
 > And I cough up my lungs  
 > Because they remind me of how it all went wrong  
 > And I leave in my heart  
 > Because I don't want to stay in the dark

If they are addressed or possibly threatened, they will stop chanting and start to claw at themselves and anyone nearby, which also injures any people observing them within a ca. 9m radius.

Those "methods" are the ones mentioned in their chanting.
