[Pseudoneo](..\..\Species\Pseudoneo.md) originally created as representative entity for someone who couldnâ€™t attend that situation.
Average in appearance, humanoid with a pale grey skin tone. 
Given a moderate intellect and animated by electricity. 
A painful, unpleasant existence.
Driven by arcanum, able to shed its skin at command, to grow a new one. 
Made to mimic, imitate someone and execute commands and instructions of lower complexity. 

Through time, as their masters and creators vanished, became skilled [hunters](Hunt) for these who dare live outside fortified city walls. 
Living almost eternal, their prey can only defend itself through wit. 
Its limited intellect is its only weakness, its hands are deft as those who it stalks: able, making tools.
