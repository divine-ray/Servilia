\#Undead #enemies 

A poor undead fellow who succumbed to the [Curse of the Undead](..\..\Overviews\Concepts\Curse%20of%20the%20Undead.md).
 

Most of them are located in the infirmary of the Necropolis.

Some make weak attempts to attack their environment in their deranged condition, dealing 1d4-1 unarmed strike.

 

Some roam the Realm aimlessly due to lacking a motivation

 

They can get helped if they get provided 1x [Bottled Embers](..\..\Items\Bottled%20Embers.md) from any NPC or PC.
