Closing down the [Fountainhead](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Long%20Savannah\Palga%20Basin\Fountainhead.md) allows the [Twilit](..\..\Realms\Planes\Twilit.md) to unfold its natural state again, unharnessed, but possibly more awake than before and thus more conversing. This process takes time, and it'll never truly regain it's prome state, as the [Echoes](..\..\Overviews\Concepts\Echoes.md) and [Twilit Rift](..\..\Overviews\Concepts\Twilit%20Rift.md)s manifest the tangible trauma caused by the millenia-long bloodletting. 

This would equate to freeing a human being from constant torment whilst sedated, a truly miserable state to be in. 

However, such action is not without consequences; as it is the Fountainhead that erected and stabilises the [Hollow Mountains](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Hollow%20Mountains\Hollow%20Mountains.md) and [Floating Islands](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Hollow%20Mountains\Ancient%20Exile\Floating%20Islands.md) in their current state. Such a decision would have to be made cautiously, since a hastily act would bring severe cataclysm to the lands. 

The [Ancients](..\..\Groupings\Factions\Ancients.md) would, however, be freed, and their derivates of Nolkan apotheoitic powers would greatly benefit the general populace to cast and weave magic.
