The development of electricity through the researchers in [Duley and Port](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Areas\Frisco%20Bay\Duley%20and%20Port.md) has been proven very crude and unrefined, but highly yielding. Some early applications, with the power made through *Steam Turbines* include electrical carriages on the [Servilian Railroad and Train Network](..\..\Groupings\Organisations\Servilian%20Railroad%20and%20Train%20Network.md) and supercharged weaponry, which has proven very violent against metallic targets. 

Someone attempted to connect a large rod directly to a generator, which created some *field*, which attracted various loose screws and other small things around. Following this, he tried to place another pole next to the main rod, which *somehow* produced current, despite not being connected to the main rod! 
He has been given research funds and supports, and seems to be on a rather promising route. A few [prototypes](Radio%20Equipment.md) have already been made, one of which integrated into *Automatia*.
