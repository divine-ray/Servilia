*The* early findings of [Electricity](Electricity.md) have been incredibly promising, and it seems that sufficiently powerful sources can be connected to a long cable, typically strung up a building or on a airship, will create a ineffable signal, which could possibly be caught and received by a similar device. 
This technology seems invaluable going forward, as it'd drastically ease our organisation of aerial traffic over at [Duley and Port](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Areas\Frisco%20Bay\Duley%20and%20Port.md), and possibly replace a fair bit of mail and courier traffic.
