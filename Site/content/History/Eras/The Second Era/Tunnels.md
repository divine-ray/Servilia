There’s a hatch in my basement. 
I have no idea how it came to be, but i know that I cannot lock it. 
My family always forbid me to move the old and unused metal oven that stood in front of it.
Now that they are dead…
I moved it anyway. Now i know.

Dear god.
I never thought that i had access to a personal railway line… 
Behind the hatch is a tunnel. Many, big tunnels. [Full of rails](..\..\..\Groupings\Organisations\Argrosy.md), but rusted and forgotten. Water is everywhere here.. wait, that's not water. 
The stench… Who knows how many hundreds if not thousands of [vermin](Rats.md) have birthed, lived and died here… Gross. 
I can't let anyone know about this, but someone has to kill all these rats!
