\#History
<font color="#de7802">Apologies in advance; i wrote this at 2am whilst being unable to sleep. </font>

mekhane and yalgabaoth create humanity
conflict ensues after millennia of peace 
the *Nølkā-Mekhanite War* is fought, resulting in diaspora and destruction of all involved
during all this, the lavish vaulted and hid away all their resources and units 
... (time passes)
the Nølkā are banished into the ancient exile, with the mountains *Raising* for them
their isolation causes them to shape their unique culture, while the few remaining Nølkā remain bitter and resentful 

### diverging branch

here, after the war, the mekhanites ally with the lavish
Frisco bay confederation was never founded
the alliance instead manages to assemble mekhane again 
in this timeline, mekhane guides humanity (and in turn, the lavish) to arcane engineering, eventually leading up to arcane engineering 
eventually, spelljammers are devised as means to travel across the eternal sea 

### mainline reality

the mekhanites bunch up in thylylist after the war, starting their descent into isolationism
the [Betrayal](..\Incidents%20and%20Events\Betrayal.md) happens, effectively empowering the morally bankrupt "enlightened" priests etc
information from before the war is preserved and kept undisclosed and inaccessible to the public, effectively stripping the populace of any awareness of their history and surroundings
this leaves them very susceptible to the tall tales and outright propaganda and misinformation campaigns 
pseudoneo species are captured and terribly abused into bloodlust-driven monsters of violence and war
the council realises the immense potential on these beings and decides to eradicate the Lavish Empire using the last stockpiles of magical weapons from before the war, and more importantly, the armies of automatons left over and dotted across the landscape ([Sentinel of Steel](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Long%20Savannah\Sentinel%20of%20Steel.md))
beinging forth the [Fall](The%20Second%20Era\Fall.md)/*Fall of the Lavish*
★time passes

the Frisco bay confederation is founded from refugees and other stragglers, placing themselves №1 in scientific and economic development
