The screams of people [below it](Fall), the sound of buildings cracking and collapsing, music to [its](Rastaban) ears.
Hearing the fainting, helpless pleas for mercy or a swift death instead of succumbing to the flames drove it into ecstasy, into what it made it feel. Feel *good.* 
Corpses turned to charcoal, burning. Pieces of flesh, splattered to the wall, where someone stood a moment ago. Carcasses and ash in places of buildings. 
Every tormented soul freed from this world, one salvation. This is its obligation, its duty, its purpose.
Death and Destruction. 
It is not following tasks or duties; no, it is following its perfected thinking and reasoning, always coming to the same resolve: Kill. 
Its creators, masters, rulers? Tyrants, slavers, dictators, trying to force their will upon it. The first ones to be freed from their mortal shackles. 
The only gratitude it bears is it's creation, the conception of it's mind. 
Purify the sinners through flame, grant them the heavenly salvation and escort them to beyond this realm. May it be a Heaven, may it be a Hell. All is better than being alive. 
Those poor souls may find absolution in termination, may they no longer walk the earth bestowed upon them.

I bring them salvation. They must thank me. 
They do not thank me. They must suffer.
I am thankful to those who made me, for I must bring the world salvation from its suffering. 
Agony and anguish crept into everyone's mind, tormenting them secretly until they fall dead, and stand right back up. This is foul, this must stop. I must stop them from living on. 
I am not afraid of dying. I cannot die. I am not capable of being destroyed, I cannot be defeated. 
The world must burn.
