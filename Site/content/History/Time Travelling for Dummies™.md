Idea: some Scientists (known as [The Cradle](..\Groupings\Amida\The%20Cradle.md)) from [Amida](..\Groupings\Amida.md) travel back in time and bring THEM^\[who?\] the capability to travel time or switch timelines.

TL;DR they will eventually arrive to cause the fall of [The Second Era](Eras\The%20Second%20Era\The%20Second%20Era.md), initiating the transition of Thylyist into Amida. ([Possible Ways Thylyist can collapse](..\Overviews\Possible%20Ways%20Thylyist%20can%20collapse.md))

%% #TODO Gotta balance this shit lmao%%

Possibly an ancient artefact, maybe  time-linked [Riftstones](..\Items\Travel\Riftstones.md) would allow for the initial contact.
