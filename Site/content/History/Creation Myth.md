\#Structure 
*Yaldabaoth* (goddess of flesh) created humans,
[Mekhane](..\Beings\Gods%20and%20Deities\Mekhane.md) gifted them machines and invention.
Yaldabaoth intended them to be uncultured and rather wild, like animals.
Mekhane wanted them to strive for greatness, using machines and the power of sciences.
