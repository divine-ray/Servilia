The long-plotted and anticipated overthrowing and coup d'état of the fully functional and well-established democratic [Council of Thylyist](..\..\Groupings\Factions\Thylyian\Council%20of%20Thylyist.md). 
Primary forces involved were the Highest [Priests of Mekhane](..\..\Groupings\Cults%20and%20Religions\Followers%20of%20Mekhane.md) and their [Zealous Soldiers](..\..\Groupings\Factions\Thylyian\Gearforged%20Vanguard.md). 
Executed in the dead of night with the deadly precision of the long-prepared military, it was like Thylyist turned inwards outside. As if a malicious parasite finally burst out of its host, killing it, rearing its ugly head. 
The display of dogma and the embrace of regression, justified to be in the name of a greater good, which was absent at all time.
