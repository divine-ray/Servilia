A formation of figures strides in the serpentine catacombs of Thylyist, heading towards their destination at a determined, steady pace. 
With respectful distance, a small squadron of guards follows, keeping pace. 
They are headed towards the [Archive of Old](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Areas\Empire%20of%20Thylyist\Archive%20of%20Old.md). 
To make sure nothing has changed, nothing left it alive. 
Every segment, the squadron moves forward, unsealing one of the many secured doors, allowing passage. The figures move, waiting for the guards to seal the door. 
This repeats until they arrive at their destination.
