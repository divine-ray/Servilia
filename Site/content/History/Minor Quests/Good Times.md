Retrieve the Vacuum Cleaner and Permit for a citizen

# song

\[SAMMY J\]  
It was a Monday  
When we took the car  
And drove it to the shops-  
\[RANDY\]  
I think it was a Tuesday-  
\[SAMMY J\]  
I'm pretty sure it wasn't-  
No, you're right, it was a Tuesday  
\[BOTH\]  
Cause Derek had the permit  
\[RANDY\]  
It's a clear way on a Monday  
\[SAMMY J\]  
Yeah, but we parked there  
\[BOTH\]  
So it must have been a Tuesday  
\[SAMMY J\]  
When we took the car-  
\[RANDY\]  
Did Derek give that permit back?  
\[SAMMY J\]  
He said he'd leave it when he went to Queensland  
\[RANDY\]  
We should chase that up  
\[SAMMY J\]  
We will  
\[BOTH\]  
Still  
\[SAMMY J\]  
We were in the car  
\[RANDY\]  
Urgh...  
\[SAMMY J\]  
Driving to the shops-  
\[RANDY\]  
I'm serious, that permit wasn't cheap

\[SAMMY J\]  
Relax, we'll get the permit back

\[RANDY\]  
That's what you said about the vacuum cleaner

\[SAMMY J\]  
Well that was different, he's got allergies

\[RANDY\]  
Like what?

\[SAMMY J\]  
You saw the rash!

\[RANDY\]  
It's eczema

\[SAMMY J\]  
He has to clean the carpet 'cause his cat's got hairy bollocks

\[RANDY\]  
He should get that thing de-sexed

\[SAMMY J\]  
He can't, he breeds them, it's his way of coping with a difficult divorce

\[RANDY\]  
As far as I can see his only allergy is giving back the shit he borrows from his neighbours

\[SAMMY J\]  
So we were driving north-

\[RANDY\]  
I mean, the guy can still afford to go to [Noosa](https://genius.com/22557194/Sammy-j-and-randy-good-times/Noosa)

\[SAMMY J\]  
Yeah, what's your point?

\[RANDY\]  
He should just buy a vacuum cleaner

\[SAMMY J\]  
Look, I leant it in good faith  
How was I to know  
He'd take it inter-state and give it to his niece for her first communion?

\[RANDY\]  
I didn't know he had a niece!

\[SAMMY J\]  
It's complicated, see, his sister had a friend that died  
She's barren so she felt obliged to care for her

\[RANDY\]  
So it's not actually his niece?

\[SAMMY J\]  
Well, not by blood

\[RANDY\]  
That's even worse, I can't believe he gave our vacuum cleaner to a random stranger!

\[SAMMY J\]  
So we were driving north-

\[RANDY\]  
South

\[SAMMY J\]  
South towards the-

\[RANDY\]  
North?

\[SAMMY J\]  
No, it was northern suburbs

\[RANDY\]  
South?

\[BOTH\]  
That's right  
The map was upside down, but  
We got there in the end

\[SAMMY J\]  
And parked outside the fish and chip shop

\[RANDY\]  
Fruit shop-

\[SAMMY J\]  
Milk bar-

\[RANDY\]  
Hardware?

\[BOTH\]  
Bake-- no, haberdashery  
It's next door

\[RANDY\]  
To the house and home shop

\[SAMMY J\]  
We went in and bought a vacuum cleaner

\[BOTH\]  
When we came outside  
[We had a parking fine](https://genius.com/25206686/Sammy-j-and-randy-good-times/We-had-a-parking-fine)

\[RANDY\]  
'Cause Derek had the permit

\[SAMMY J\]  
He said he'd give it back!

\[RANDY\]  
He didn't!

\[SAMMY J\]  
Evidently!

\[RANDY\]  
I won't be paying that!

\[SAMMY J\]  
I'm trying to tell a fuckin' story

\[RANDY\]  
Well, tell it then

\[SAMMY J\]  
I will

\[RANDY\]  
Good!

\[SAMMY J\]  
I'm telling it right now!

\[RANDY\]  
Oh he's telling it!

\[SAMMY J\]  
Yes I'm trying to!

\[RANDY\]  
Well go on, tell it!

\[SAMMY J\]  
Fine I'll tell it!  
We were driving  
Home after the shops

\[RANDY\]  
But when we pulled into the driveway

\[SAMMY J\]  
Felt a bump

\[RANDY\]  
Got out

\[BOTH\]  
And realised we'd run over Derek's cat  
Who was being held  
By Derek at the time  
We took the permit from his cold, dead hands and ran away  
Good times!
