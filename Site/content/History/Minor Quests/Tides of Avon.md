\#QUEST 
**Main objective: Investigate the abnormally extreme tides of [Avon](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Areas\Empire%20of%20Thylyist\Empire%20of%20Thylyist.md#thylyian-districts).**

### Detailed Description:

The citizens, especially maritime folk, have reported extreme tides (flooding and ebb), and they reached out to the newfound adventurer party.

* Research about similar occurrences.
* Localise the phenomenon.
  * The source is supposedly a big ass sea serpent which makes vortexes.
  * Either:
    * Negotiate with it by offering food regularly (try to not get eaten)
    * Slay it.

### Conclusion:

Reputation increase, Monetary reward, sea serpent scales + bones (crafting/magic component).
