The [plane](Planes.canvas) where all-encompassing, omnipotent deities, entities and concepts reside. Impossible to access by anyone who is not one of them. 
The name originally came from the fact that the Fountainhead cannot contain these entities, which earned them the title "beyond the exile".

Despite their infinite and incomprehensible power, these entities remain possible prey to those forces reaching beyond a single universe and its planes, those who scowl at the concept of a singular existence, those who will always exist, outside all time. 

Unbeknown to anyone is if this is the furthest reach of the [Old Gods](..\..\Beings\Gods%20and%20Deities\Old%20Gods.md) or if there's more.
