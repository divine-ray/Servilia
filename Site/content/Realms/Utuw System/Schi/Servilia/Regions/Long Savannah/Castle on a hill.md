Running up [A Hill](A%20Hill.md), there it has a lonely castle, set to rot and salvage.
It's roofing, originally copper, has been completely torn out, and some sections have been demolished.
Former Elvin stronghold, destroyed in the genocidal *sweep of Thylyist against the Lavish*.
After the devastation of it and the surrounding areas, scavengers and pillagers tore out anything they could peddle away, leaving the stone brick walls towering like husks. 

[Leyline](..\..\..\..\..\..\Overviews\Concepts\Magic%20System\Leyline.md) node due to the souls of unrighteously deceased inhabiting it, which partially feeds the Children.

Headquarters to the [Children of The Flame](..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Cults%20and%20Religions\Children%20of%20The%20Flame.md). Epicentre of the [Scorched Acres](Scorched%20Acres.md), hard shell to the *Crimson Heart*, protecting it and the children from any outsiders. 

Otherwise Home to a few hollowed elvs, who get supervised by benevolent gnomes/gremlins.
