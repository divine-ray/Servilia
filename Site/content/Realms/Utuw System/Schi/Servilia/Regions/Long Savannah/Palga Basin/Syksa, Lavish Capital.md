## tags: Lavish, Settlements, Locations

The glorious metropolis of the Lavish Empire, home to most Lavish within Servilia.
Settled in the middle of the [Palga Basin](Palga%20Basin.md), it harboured the [Fountainhead](Fountainhead.md) and all that is Lavish, including the first experimental [Argrosy](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Organisations\Argrosy.md) (which faced refinement later on), the biological laboratories in which the [Pseudoneo](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Beings\Species\Pseudoneo.md) have been born, and more. 

Buried deep below the surface lay forgotten [bunkers](First%20Vault.md), built for the anticipated cataclysm.

## Architecture

Due to the relative absence of gravity and pressure regulation underwater[^1], their architecture style is all that remained known to the modern ages, dubbing their name: Lavish. 
Huge, towering buildings, each decorated and detailed worthy of a emperor's palace, showing off their craftsmanship, wealth, and expertise.

[^1]: Noteworthy to a observer is the fact that they did not have to per-se empty their buildings, it simply contained a filtered and more oxygenated water than the rest of the basin.
