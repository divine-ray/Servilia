\#Void #locations #Ruin 

This is the interdimensional drilling rig that leads to [Twilit](..\..\..\..\..\..\Planes\Twilit.md) and eventually, the void.
The borehole is [physically accessible](The%20Abyss.md). 
Once built as siphon to channel more energies from the Twilit into the material realm, designed to power all *Arcane Engineering* throughout the continent. It was later redone and enhanced to allow massive terraforming projects, which culminated in the *Raising* of the [Hollow Mountains](..\..\Hollow%20Mountains\Hollow%20Mountains.md). 

And now that the [The Lavish Empire](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Factions\The%20Lavish%20Empire.md) aren't here to maintain the catalyst of the Fountainhead, the whole [Between](..\..\..\..\..\..\Planes\Between.md) creatures (and -energies) come crawling through the wastes, corrupting the landscape and it's residents. 

 > 
 > \#QUEST: retrieve the Catalyst from ??? And repair the Fountainhead
 > \#QUEST : Destroy and seal the Fountainhead

The Wastes around the FH have become [Gliss](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Items\Components,%20Ingredients\Chunk%20of%20Gliss.md), a substance with close to zero physical properties, thus, no colour or friction
