The Pit into [nothingness](..\..\..\..\..\..\Planes\Dark%20Domain\The%20Void.md), a bottomless well-pit, through which only death and disease is conveyed. 
One daring might take the plunge, lest never return, never the same.
It changes people. It changed the stretches of [salt flats](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Items\Components,%20Ingredients\Chunk%20of%20Gliss.md) around it. 
Whoever dares to step beyond the edge is bound to perish.
[Or are they?](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Items\Artifacts\Voidtouched%20Boots.md)

Entryway to the spaces beyond the material world; considered the mound of hell by many. 
Twisted into gruesome shapes from the writhing agony and pain-made-matter of the [Twilit](..\..\..\..\..\..\Planes\Twilit.md). 
Dark things come this way, seeking out to destroy and carve out those susceptible.
