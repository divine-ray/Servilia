Within the [Hollow Mountains](Hollow%20Mountains.md), [Dwarves](..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Dwarves.md) once struck groundwater, boiling and steaming to the touch.
This led to the discovery of the %%Grand Heater Below, pending%%, easily being able to produce steam to drive dwarven forges and machining alike. 
Originally, the superheated water was discovered to connect through the [Long Savannah](..\Long%20Savannah\Long%20Savannah.md) up until through the [Scorched Acres](..\Long%20Savannah\Scorched%20Acres.md), where the Heart siphoned the heat. 
One most notable surface breach of this hot water running below are the *Steam Gardens*.
