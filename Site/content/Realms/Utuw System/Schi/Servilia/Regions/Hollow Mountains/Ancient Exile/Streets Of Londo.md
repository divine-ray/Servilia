Have you seen the old man  
In the closed down market  
Kicking up the papers  
With his worn out shoes?  
In his eyes, you see no pride  
Hand held loosely at his side  
Yesterday's paper  
Telling yesterday's news 
-
Have you seen the old girl  
Who walks the streets of London  
Dirt in her hair  
And her clothes in rags?  
-
She's no time for talking  
She just keeps right on walking  
Carrying her home  
In two carrier bags  
-
In the all night cafe  
At a quarter past eleven  
Same old man  
Sitting there on his own  
-
Looking at the world  
Over the rim of his tea cup  
Each tea lasts an hour  
And he wanders home alone  
-
Have you seen the old man  
Outside the seaman's mission  
Memory fading with  
The medal ribbons that he wears?  
-
In our winter city  
The rain cries a little pity  
For one more forgotten hero  
And a world that doesn't care  
-
So, how can you tell me you're lonely  
And say for you that the sun don't shine?  
Let me take you by the hand  
And lead you through the streets of London  
I'll show you something to make you change your mind
