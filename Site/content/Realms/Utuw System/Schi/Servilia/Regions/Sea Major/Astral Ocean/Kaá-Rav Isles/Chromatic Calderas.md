Part of the [Astral Ocean](..\Astral%20Ocean.md) #Regions, subdivision of [Ka√°-Rav](Ka%C3%A1-Rav.md). 

The ocean spans over the edges of multiple tectonic plates, and therefore has a high volcanic and geologic activity.
This shaped a high number of atolls and still-active volcanoes, and those atolls and islands feature astounding numbers of geysers, hot springs and alike.
A certain series of volcanoes and calderas is doused in abundance of mineral-sourced colours.

These bear a special trait: Observing a specific one being active causes a outburst of specific emotions in the observer, the emotions being associated to the observed colour.

Few groups of sorcerers consider this place the goal of a decade-long pilgrimage.

*Future:*
Ground penetrating radar scans and analysis resulted that a [anomalous object](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Beings\Gods%20and%20Deities\Mekhane.md) is buried in the magma chambers which channels a massive amount of Amarisk into the magma. This possibly makes the emotions associate to colours, and the activity of each caldera might be a way of the [Twilit](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Planes\Twilit.md) to express itself.
