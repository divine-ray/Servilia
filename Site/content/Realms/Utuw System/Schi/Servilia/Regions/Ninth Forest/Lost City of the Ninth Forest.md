# During [The First Era](..\..\..\..\..\..\History\Eras\The%20First%20Era\The%20First%20Era.md):

A flourishing and thriving city, dedicated towards research and trade. 
A joint effort and collaboration between the Lavish, Dragonkin and Humanity gave way for a ultimate creation: a draconic-blooded humanoid, augmented with Pseudoneo biotechnology, who have dubbed themselves *Varuú*.
This city was the one to be gifted the first [Argrosy](..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Organisations\Argrosy.md) station, which remains functional. 
Given the diverse cultural mix present, it is considered necessary to go vertical, both into the ground and into the skies, to accommodate all residents.
Relics of their ages can only be called gizmos, however, some of which, remain [lethal and feared](..\..\..\..\..\..\Items\Weaponry\Propelled%20Projectile\OA-WS%20BST%20Model%207%E2%81%BF.md). 

The *Varuú*, said humanoid hybrids, are infusing their architecture with twilight, which turns out to be a resounding success, as it drastically eases construction work. Earthen spirits and similar aberrations are usually invited, and happily reside in their buildings, as their cheerful character gives each building a own flair and style.

### Lich Reliquary

Before [Dying ceased](How%20Dying%20ceased.md), turning oneself lichen was a rare, but present procedure to gain longevity. This required safekeeping of the vessels, and therefore, the foundation for the deepest layers of [Sepulchre](Sepulchre.md) have been laid: to vault off and preserve Lich Vessels. 

# During [The Second Era](..\..\..\..\..\..\History\Eras\The%20Second%20Era\The%20Second%20Era.md):

A overgrown city, situated in the [Ninth Forest](Ninth%20Forest.md), [laid to waste](..\..\..\..\..\..\History\Eras\The%20Second%20Era\Fall.md) and rot long ago. Perhaps another victim of vessel raids?

This place has been dubbed Tombstone by explorers and scavengers, as its perfect disassembly draws parallels to the masonry on a tombstone. 

Inspection reveals that most buildings seem to have disassembled themselves, in orderly Disarray 

* Bricks missing
* Things lacking in places where they should be

*With good perception:* The entire area is loudly screaming "LEAVE AND DON'T RETURN"

The roads of this place vaguely shimmer in golden tones.
You easily notice the odd layouts of where buildings must've stood or roads have passed, there seems to be no curvature at all, as if it were all perfectly rectangular. 
It is hard to imagine how it must've shone in it's original, pristine state.
