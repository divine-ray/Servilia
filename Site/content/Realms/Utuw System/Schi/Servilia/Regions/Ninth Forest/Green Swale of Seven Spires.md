The lush heart of the forested hell that is the [Ninth Forest](Ninth%20Forest.md). 
Around the indented basin-lake tower seven spires, adorned with vines and tangles. 
The basin-lake is the beginning and end of many rivers and streams throughout the Ninth Forest, some of which extend [underground](Caverns.md). 

Well-guarded by raised, enclosing cliff faces, who raise suspicion about natural formation. 
Certainly peculiar [creatures](..\..\..\..\..\..\Beings\Creatures\Amphitheriid.md) reside here, most of which pose significant threats and risks towards unsuspecting or inexperienced travellers. 
Several camps of many-such travellers have been found without their owners, left to decay, with no signs of their whereabouts and seemingly sudden disappearance.
