The Court to [Tombstone](Lost%20City%20of%20the%20Ninth%20Forest.md), where faith is decided upon. 
Arches resemble a spacious ceiling, stone paves the floor in elaborate patterns. 
Upon a elevated podium resides *The One Who Judges* and the Masked Ones. 
Eroded, withered copper spires form the corners and pillars of the flooring, conducting electricity from the thunderclouds residing above. 
Eleven and twenty pedestals seat the judges, five for the judged, may their verdict be righteous and swift. 
None partaking in the trials can see another; for they are shrouded to assure neutrality.
