A wide-spanning forest ecosystem, including rain-forest but also temperate towards Mediterranean plant life.

Central to it is the [Green Swale of Seven Spires](Green%20Swale%20of%20Seven%20Spires.md).
Officially termed Ninth Forest due to itâ€™s position on the clock, if the continent would be abstracted into a clock. 
Colloquially dubbed "Jungle of Megaliths" due to many massive rocky spires scattered throughout, whose origins or purpose remain unknown and forgotten. 

Most of the coast to this forested region has developed into a independent, yet adjacent ecosphere, the [Lunar Mangroves](..\Sea%20Major\Astral%20Ocean\Lunar%20Mangroves.md).
