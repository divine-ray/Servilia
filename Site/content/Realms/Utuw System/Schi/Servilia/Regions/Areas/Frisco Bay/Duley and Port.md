## Airport and Scientific Nexus in the *Frisco Bay*

Duley and -Port is the scientific driver of the [Frisco Bay Confederation](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Frisco\Frisco%20Bay%20Confederation.md) and central to the region's aerial transport. 

It is known for its many open plazas and squares which are plated with bronze and other copper alloys, same as the rooves.  
Many of these squares are long and rectangular, allowing smaller, winged aircraft to land and start from them. Additionally, all plazas are outfitted with watchtowers to regulate traffic that also double as communication station by using a system akin to semaphores and light beam Morse code. 

### Architecture

Buildings here are typically two storeys high, and usually have at least one cellar layer. 
Most cellars are interconnected through neighbouring secured doors and tunnels, which shape secondary means of transport. 
The biggest tunnels here have a whopping four lanes, two each, stacked upon each other. Ventilation usually poses a hassle though, but early experiments with electricity have shown to be promising. 
Another ongoing experiment is attempting to fit the established and well-performing rail network into these tunnels. 

### Notable Locations

A large scribe's workshop, served by a clowder of cats. The cats usually divide their time between playing, sleeping, and working on the pages of a book of omens and portents. If asked by a wizard, they may copy a spellbook or scroll, given the materials, but no more often than once per month. 
This business has proven fruitful, and several branch stores are under construction, as their services are excellent in terms of speed and quality. 
Customers may order copies of any book here as long as it's contents aren't of dangerous nature, as these cats value their safety and comfort over all else. 

They have a union, which has claimed the rights on the first version of [book presses](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\History\Technological%20Advancements\Development%20of%20Printing.md).

#### Port

A bit out of the central area is the namesake Port, where airships and other updraft based vessels dock. This port is constructed from sky-scraping towers, which extend in many directions on several layers to house the sizable throughput in goods and people. On the ground, in close proximity to the centre, lies the Duley Grand Station, which provides means to rapidly travel to Frisco to access the Servilian Railroad. 
Cargo transfer is provided close by, and only little away.
