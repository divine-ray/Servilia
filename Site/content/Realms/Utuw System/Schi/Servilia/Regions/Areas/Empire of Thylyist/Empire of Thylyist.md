Capital of the human population; highly advanced in mechanics and metalworking. However, they are strictly conservative, if not regressive, about more advanced technology due to their [religious dogmata](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Cults%20and%20Religions\Followers%20of%20Mekhane.md). 
The [Archive](Archive%20of%20Old.md) within the lowest Levels feature the staggering history of Thylyist: they *eradicated* [The Lavish Empire](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Factions\The%20Lavish%20Empire.md) after abusing them to forcibly relocate the god-gone *Nølkā*. -> [The Second Era](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\History\Eras\The%20Second%20Era\The%20Second%20Era.md)
Amida's sector structure is derived from the fact that Thylyist already existed as megacity with several layers.
The Council actually feeds the residents a whole different story, "they're all evil etc etc" and "magic is bad"

* Thylyian doctrine

### Thylyian Districts

Thylyist's urban sprawl and expansionism has engulfed a fair section of the coastal area. 
The "City" as a whole actually is consisting out of several sectors (former provinces), named after their function and former settlement. 

* ###### Cudgetown, Trade District

* ###### Brampton, ?

* ###### Thylyist itself

* ###### Avon, Naval District
  
  * Port, Haven, Fishing
* ###### Haymouthton, Residential District

* ###### Billinghurst, Industrial District

* ###### Necket, Manufacturing District

### The [Council of Thylyist](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Factions\Thylyian\Council%20of%20Thylyist.md)

\#Thylyist 
Once the shining example of democracy, this institution has been overthrown after the [Betrayal](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\History\Incidents%20and%20Events\Betrayal.md).
Ever since, the [Followers of Mekhane](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Cults%20and%20Religions\Followers%20of%20Mekhane.md) reign with a [iron fist](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Factions\Thylyian\Gearforged%20Vanguard.md), thwarting any opposition and anything that could possibly threaten their reign. 
The council of seven individuals governing the City Empire of Thylyist. 
They are seen as ethereal and incorporeal from the population.
Members of the council are very rarely seen in persona and they employ life-extending technology.
Every 16 orbital periods of Heaugi (16op x 64d/op = 1024d) ,they hold a secret vote if one member has become untrustworthy and requires *replacements*. 
A replacement is selected from a pool of unknowing citizens.
[But their reign is flimsy, and bound to fall and burn.](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Overviews\Possible%20Ways%20Thylyist%20can%20collapse.md)
They always use code names or those that don’t change.

###### Old Stuff

It works similar to the O5 council, 7 anonymous and identity-cleansed "immortals" that do stuff

The Administrator is actually a halfbreed of god and dragon and the only one who's capable and knowing of magic in Thylyist

"Past" iteration of #Amida [Amida](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Amida.md)

## Thylyist Lore

In [The First Era](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\History\Eras\The%20First%20Era\The%20First%20Era.md), Thylyist flourished in cooperation with the Lavish and Ancients, who all coexisted peacefully.
The human society within the lesser confines of the Thylyian borders flourished and technology was easily compatible and intertwined with magic. 
During the first era, the arcane conductivity of beryllium bronze was discovered, which led to its wide-employed use, which persists to the current date. 
The pre-pre-predecessors of their culture and technology were actually weaving magic into their mechanisms and such, and after The Ancient Happening (TAH😛) the then-council banished and stigmatised any arcane doing, but the usage of beryllium bronze as main alloy remained.
⬆️This makes all machinery react really interesting with magic
Oi, what if the br-bronze attracts spirits and they try to ward them off?
The Ancient Happening occurred in around 1950-1970's of their time
Brotherhood Backstab is the entry into the Deep Archives of their doing of nuking the Lavish (Dated 1971)
The Thylyian council has fallen unknowing of their doings in the past, and thus forgot about the Fountainhead.
