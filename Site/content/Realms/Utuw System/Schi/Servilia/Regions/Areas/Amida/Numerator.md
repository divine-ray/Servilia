\#Amida 
Big if not titanic organic and sentient supercomputers that search for a solution to the [Curse of the Undead](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Overviews\Concepts\Curse%20of%20the%20Undead.md). Their entire structure houses a sector each, as they govern infrastructure. 
Numerators were able to interact with the control of the [SC-AM](..\..\Long%20Savannah\Palga%20Basin\SC-AM.md) project and tap the power output for [Amida](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Amida.md).
Most of the heat produced is absorbed by purposed [The Cold](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Factions\The%20Cold.md) tissue to recuperate energy and not to devastate the environment like Rainworld.

Modified Cold tissue has been tamed to form transport pathways throughout each Numerator structure; Strands and bundles of neurons, veins and other capillary paths facilitate most matter and information (including civilian) transport within each numerator.
General population is aware of the rough task of the numerators but they don't really care other than for housing and *utilities*. 

As each Numerator is sentient, they shifted and changed their structure to reflect and express themselves, which contributed to the erratic and organic looks of Amida as whole. 
Each Sector/Numerator has grown and accustomed to a specific populace group or thematic scheme which correlates to their personality. 
Each numerator possesses an avatar, which is usually entrapped within its chamber. Avatars outside their chamber are rarely seen, and oftentimes carry a prophetical gossip as it means that this numerator was not able to ‘remotely’ solve the problem at hand. 

The collective of Numerators is possibly scheming a coup or other way to rid of the corporate board.

## Sectors, as divided by Numerator:

* *Amida-5* is the government/corporate HQ and management
  Control
* *Amida-8*  is the synth^\[read:android, pseudoneo\] ghetto
  Regrets for Newborn
* *Amida-9* is the Space elevator and [Mass transit hub.](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Organisations\Argrosy.md)
  Icarus
* *Amida-11* is the accumulation sector of furries. 
  Alteration
* [Amida-12](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\WIP%20or%20Projects\TO-DO\Amida-12.md) is centred around brothels, clubs and other institutions of pleasure. 
  Desire 
  Numerators not integrated into the collective^\[The corporate-associated numerators are seen as inferior, as they're severely restrained in their degrees of freedom.\]
* *A-5b*
  [APAS Ltd.](..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Amida\APAS%20Ltd..md) HQ, R&D, Testing and Deployment 
* *A-5c'a*
  *protoGen Industrial Group* HQ, Fabrication and R&D
