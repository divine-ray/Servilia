\#Areas #Northern-Reaches 

Outside of the harsh rocks and ice, there is a far extending tundra, which is frozen with permafrost even in seemingly illogical stretches. The temperature there tends to vary per-region, and some lines tend to be notably colder. Based on the proximity to the [Heart of Cold](..\..\..\..\..\..\Beings\Heart%20of%20Cold.md), these temperature shifts might be effects of its accursed veins running below the surface.
Sometimes, the veins are seen, as the despicable conduits break through the surface, encased in clearest ice, cold enough to ensnare one's breath whole. 
Entrapping even the aurora itself, the veins cloud themselves in the miraculous fog of the skies. Lest their disguise nothing but a mere play, a dalliance.
