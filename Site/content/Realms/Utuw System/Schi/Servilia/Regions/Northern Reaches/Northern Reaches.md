\#Regions 

The area of a slightly displaced polar cap. Home to the [Empire of Winds](..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Factions\Empire%20of%20Winds.md) and [The Cold](..\..\..\..\..\..\Groupings\Factions\The%20Cold.md).

Typically perpetually covered in snow and always arctic cold (ca. -20 to -40°C).

Extremely harsh environment conditions, hence why the Empire of Wind and its "citizens" is the predominant species.

 

This region is heavily influenced by the now-dead volcanism and the everlasting cold.

Most significant are towering [Alp Peaks](Alp%20Peaks.md), which add the unique climatic aspect by blocking off winds from the sea, a distant and deviated arm of the Astral Ocean.

These peaks seem to be haunted by poltergeists and memetic nightmares, but only during night. This may be a influence from the deviated sea. An above average occurrence of night runners have been spotted here¿¡

A similarly weird area origins from those peaks, being the [Eternal Glacier](Eternal%20Glacier.md). This glacier poses a temporal anomaly, as anything within its area appears frozen to outside observers. Still, being a glacier, it grinds down its way, eventually into the ocean, where the anomalous effects begin to fade and eventually cease.

Nevertheless, a colossal spire of the hardest rock splits some arm or branch of the glacier, which shapes a massive *Icy Plains*, which isn't subjected to the glacial movement.
