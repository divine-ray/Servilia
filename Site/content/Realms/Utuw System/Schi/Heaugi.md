Moon of Schi. Tiny rocky core and mostly water and ice. 
A [Lavish](..\..\..\Beings\Species\Lavish.md) colony is suspected in these subsurface oceans.
It emits a significant impact on the twilight continuum of Schi.

Forays through the twilit of Schi and Consultation with *Heaugi ut-TabƒÅnah* have yielded... not much. 
Horrors birthed through dread and anxiety dwell below the thick, but fragile icy shell. One Ocean, deeper than mankind's machinery will ever reach. 
Dark.
Cold.
Alone, but what certainty is there to this promise?
One man may bestow their gaze upon this lost child of a moon and consider it a frozen, watery hell. 
One *???* [^1] may consider this place almost ideal, free of predators, isolated. A perfect canvas. 



[^1]: Lavish, replaced due to their lack of a persistent written term for themselves.
