We are here because you are not.
Wait, how are you reading this if you cant be here?
Here at the end of time we are, and we don’t really know why.
[Someone](..\..\Beings\Gods%20and%20Deities\Old%20Gods.md) thought it’d be amusing to see a group of stragglers try to reverse time or something. 
We might look like gods, but trust me, compared to *them* we are nothing. Vermin at best. Oh well, we got used to it. Not like we can change anything, or anyone else will do so for us, and the chances of us getting a McGuffin to work for us also won’t happen. 

If you’re reading this, it most likely means something went either horribly wrong (for you) or terrifically right (for us). 
Judge it as you want, or don’t. We won’t care.

Won’t you come in, settle down, have a coffee or tea from the *Café at the End of Time*?
It’s not really time to make a change, just relax. 
Only look at me, I am old, but i might be happy. I was once like you before, you know.
Take your time for whatever you want to do, you’ll still be here tomorrow.
But something else.. maybe won’t. That’s your dreams and hopes.
I can’t really apologize here - it’s just how it goes. 
I only found solace in believing in nothing, nihilism, as they call it. 
Pretty sure that’s the only way you can exist here without going nuts.
