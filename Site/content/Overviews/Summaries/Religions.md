A comprehensive summary of Cults, Organised Religions and other followings present in Servilia. 
Loosely sorted by impact and known member count. 

## [Followers of Mekhane](..\..\Groupings\Cults%20and%20Religions\Followers%20of%20Mekhane.md)

One of the two big religions ever formed in Servilia, this religion descended from the remnants of their once-great Mekhanite religion. 
Originally created as direct worshippers of [Mekhane](..\..\Beings\Gods%20and%20Deities\Mekhane.md)s will at the conception of Mankind, now turned into a lesser, deviated hodgepodge, in which their highest ranks assume the positions of dictatorship. 
After the *Nølkā-Mekhanite War*, they broke down, scrambled at the destruction of their god, Mekhane. Having received the order to restore and *to put him back together*, they set out in massive reconissance operations to retrieve parts at all costs, but eventually gave up, eventually curling up into the [Empire of Thylyist](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Areas\Empire%20of%20Thylyist\Empire%20of%20Thylyist.md), a locked-down isolationist state where free speech and thought is rare. 
As they seized the government through religious soliders and warriors, the empire of Thylyist entered a catatonic state of regression and standstill.

### [True Machinists](..\..\Groupings\Cults%20and%20Religions\True%20Machinists.md)

Disagreement in regards to teaching and execution of the holy scriptures within the Mekhanites has led rise to a new movement, who believe that the interpretation of the Mekhanites is against the design of the *Blessed Machine*.
Additionally, the adherents of the Machinists believe that the human flesh is inferior to the Machine, and thus seek to replace it through metal. 

## *Nølkā*

The other big religion, directly [opposing](..\Prime%20Clash%20of%20Nolka%20vs%20Mekhanites.md) the Mekhanites. Mostly untied from a deity, but rather oriented around becoming their own gods through [Apotheosis](..\Concepts\Apotheosis.md). Their only notable figure is their lost prophet, who attempted to topple and kill *Yaldabaoth*, the Chaos-Mother of Mankind. 
Survived the War barely, now is scattered across the continent in loose village groups and within the [Ancient Exile](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Hollow%20Mountains\Ancient%20Exile.md).
