Welcome, foreigner.  
Oh, what drives you around, into my humble domicile?
Nevertheless, thou appear to seek answers to thy questions; who I shall provide.
But to which crevice of the continent is your interest?

The Continent Servilia is divided in five to six major regions, with two lesser. 
The Major regions include.

  A large, flat stretch of land, which undergone a large climate shift after a natural fission reactor has surfaced and directed its thermal output upon the plains. 

* [Sea Major](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Sea%20Major\Sea%20Major.md)
  The majority of the oceans and water.
