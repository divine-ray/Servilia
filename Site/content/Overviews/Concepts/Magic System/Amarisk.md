A particle-wave, emitted by metabolical activities, specifically neural activities. It does not interact with any force but the four primordial interaction forces, including electromagnetism. 
This causes it to build up within the gravity well of a planet, eventually causing [Ignition Events](Ignition%20Events.md) after sufficient buildup. 

The interaction with electromagnetism has given lead to *Arcane Engineering* before, but only few viable constructs have stemmed from this.
