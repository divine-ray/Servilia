Strands of energies, stretching across space and time.
Like strings pinned down, they tangle up and straighten again.
One of the many shapes of [Amarisk](Amarisk.md)- yet not woven of [Twilit](..\..\..\Realms\Planes\Twilit.md). 
Unique in their own ways, these threads connect places and planets. 
Soaring heights and hills cause ties and tangle, plains soothe the weave.
