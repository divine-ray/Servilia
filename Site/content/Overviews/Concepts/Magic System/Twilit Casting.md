This article is about the standardised ways and procedures of casting twilit, the magical force ever-present on the lands of Schi.
The Twilit and Amarisk are ever-present, and oftentimes manifest themselves spontaneously in various phenomenon of a broad range. 
Utilising Twilit by a sentient being requires quite some preparation and alteration to oneâ€™s body and soul, which makes for a high entry requirement. This keeps most, if not all, common folk away from weaving twilit, as few are willing to dedicate their entire life towards the ways of the weave. 
The bodily modifications required such as implants are oftentimes disfiguring, yet necessary for those born without the *gift* of natural channelling.

#### Gauntlet Spellcasting, Weaving

1. Enable *the implant* to tap the twilit
1. Have the required conditions met for conducting twilit unscathed
   (you're causing a localised rift in spacetime in/on the implant)
1. Channel the Twilit through your body, and optionally, additional conductors (wires, veins, etc.)
1. Concentrate, focusing these energies through intense Intent and Will
1. Call forth to the [Elemental Force](Forces.canvas) one wishes to utilise by sacrificing a measure of material 
   Things the caster or force itself associates with the force, in order to gain benevolence.
1. Shift the focus of the twilit-indent with the desired element into articulation, such as hands and speech
1. Produce the Woven, the confined and suspended spell through articulation such as gestures or incantation
1. Release the Woven with Intent, defining its behaviour.
   Such as Projectile, Lingering mist, Self, etc.
   **OR** take the woven and cast it into a Cypher (or any other carrier) for later use

#### Arcane Material Studies

Organic and natural materials conduct twilit best, with the affinity declining until aversion/drawbacks occurring as the material is refined and worked further.
%%flesh, biomass, living bodies, leather, fabric, minerals, ores, gem\*stones, pure metals (commonly copper, silver, iron/steel, beryllium bronze, brass)%%
following tierlist (best to worst):

* Organic
  1. Living individuals/bodies
  1. Flesh
  1. Other unspecified organic tissues
  1. Fabric
  1. Leather
  1. Synthetic Polymers and tissues
* Inorganic
  1. Minerals and solid sediments
  1. Gems and Gemstones
  1. Polished and cut gems/gemstones
  1. Refined, purified metals
     Enchanted metals and alloys such as Ithildine and Inanisthine pose an exception to this, as their conductivity is artificially boosted, excelling among inorganic substances.
