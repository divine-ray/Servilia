\#Structure 

The *Nølkā* and [Mekhanites](..\Groupings\Cults%20and%20Religions\Followers%20of%20Mekhane.md) are inspired, and mostly based off, the SCP Wiki Community. 
For the present moment (12.03.2024), the *Oneiroi Collective* is also named after the SCP Wiki Group Of Interest. 
[Link to the Church of the Broken God Hub](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/church-of-the-broken-god-hub) and [Likewise for Sarkicism/Nälkä.](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sarkicism-hub)
I do not intend to plagiarise or otherwise claim these as truly my ideas; their original conception, attribution and IP belongs to the authors of the SCP Wiki.

I do not claim any listed works in [References](References.md) as my own nor do I (intend to) capitalise upon them, they only serve a role as inspiration.
Most of this project boils down as a amalgam and combination of many media influences, and purposes as a overarching canon to unify many works of art and other media.   ^f2df94

Many other inspirations and adaptations have been taken from other media, please refer to [References](References.md).
