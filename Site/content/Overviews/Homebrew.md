### Twilit/Amarisk

instead of wizards, mages and so on "just" using spell books, gestures and incantations, they actually use those to open a connection to and tap the twilight, with the various articulations serving as shaping. sorcerers on the other hand (those with a genetic predisposition), directly access the raw Amarisk by using their whole body as channel and catalyst, with most of the shaping happening unconsciously. this is magnitudes more powerful if properly utilised, but also way more chaotic since the flow of Amarisk is extremely unpredictable in its raw state. tapping raw Amarisk is akin to planting your face into a undisturbed surface of fluid: it throws notable disruptions.

### Mekhane and the Plane of Mechanus

After the War of the Flesh, Mekhane, or rather, his remains not left on Schi, found their way to the plane of Mechanus, integrating himself into the Primus, fusing into a new entity (who's yet to be named). This entity serves both functions; logic and order (and rule over the modrons), and also machine and gear. They share their vessel/shell, but their consciousness remains mostly split and distinct as two. 
His Divine Reassembly would allow Mekhane to regain his powers and become independent of the hull of the Primus. However, his aeons within the plane of Mechanus disembodied him, and the Divine Reassembly would solely provide his Powers and Spirit a vessel to the material plane. His spirit remains free within Mechanus and all that is mechanical. 

### Dragons

they exist. though, most of them (80-95%) live and abide by the laws of Peace declared for members of [Kva'al](..\Groupings\Cultures\Kva'al.md). In effect, nearly all dragons live isolated from other sentient life in the general areas of the ribs and hollow mountains. 
Only few individuals (\<100) are known to live without their culture, which are the looked down upon chromatic beasts that kill and destroy for their own pleasure. 

### Planar modifications

there's a extra/new plane that is home to all TabaÃ±aya and Pulastaya, and is the place where they primarily reside. 
the Limbo of 5e is overlapping with the void, transitioning into one another. 

## Action modifications

* Players get three(!) actions per turn, but a massively larger choice of actions to do (some weapons/items requiring more than one action)
