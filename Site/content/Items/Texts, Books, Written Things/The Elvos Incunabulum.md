A compendium bound in thin marble slates set with round moonstone.
It is locked with a intricate mechanism which seems to resemble the local constellations. Closer observation has resulted that the various planets on the cover move, according to their real position. This leads to the conclusion that it only might open during a special constellation or arrangement.

Perhaps someone versed with the [night sky](Lunatics.md) might be able to help?
