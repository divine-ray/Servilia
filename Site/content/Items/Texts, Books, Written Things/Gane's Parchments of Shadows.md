A heavy libram bound in stained glass plates. It is sealed by fate, and can be opened only within the [Court of Storms](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Ninth%20Forest\Court%20of%20Storms.md). The glass plates show signs of attempts to forcibly open it, which are visibly malformed, as if the glass melted and cooled. Attempting to raise the covers causes little arcs of electricity to jump between the reinforced edges...
It's contents are fabled to be arcane secrets of the arts of necromancy and voidweaving, banished and condemned into this hulk of a tome. 
%%related to Tombstone and the old lich's grave within, as it is *the* necropolis%%
