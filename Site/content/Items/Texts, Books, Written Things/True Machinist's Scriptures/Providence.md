From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of steel. I aspired to *the purity* of the *Blessed Machine*. Your kind cling to your flesh, as though it will not decay and fail you. One day the crude biomass you call the temple [will wither](..\..\..\Beings\Creatures\Hollowed.md), and you will beg [my kind](..\..\..\Groupings\Cults%20and%20Religions\True%20Machinists.md) to save you. But I am already saved, for [The Machine](..\..\..\Beings\Gods%20and%20Deities\Mekhane.md) is immortalâ€¦ Even in death I serve [Mekhane](..\..\..\Beings\Gods%20and%20Deities\Mekhane.md).
