\#Item #Weapon 
*Origin: Lost.*
%%Varu√∫ grenade launcher for stronger cyphers. Ranged Cypher Launcher %%
This peculiar piece of handheld weaponry features seven tubes on a rotary drum, each of which appear to be fitted silver, engraved with runes. Contrary to that, the entire frame except the grips (back and main trigger) appear as dull, greyish-black metal, which is cold to the touch. 
The drum can be swayed to the side at the touch of a rune above its axle, presumably for loading the tubes. 
A removable shoulder stock has been added above the trigger grip, which is held in place by several locked clasps. 
A add-on rail spans the length from above the drum to almost the end of the muzzle. A ruined mount is fixed into place here, without any discernible function. 

The pin appears to be a brightly-glowing orange-yellow crystal, which radiates a seemingly infinite warmth. 

It appears that the chambers of the drum magnetically attract properly shaped potion vials and those [strange objects](..\Cyphers.md) you kept finding. 
This weapon is apparently capable of directly firing spells from their material components without any previous preparations. 

%%if the model 7 wasn't horrible and powerful enough, this bad bitch will throw arcane war crimes right into the face of the unfortunate guy on the other end of it%%
