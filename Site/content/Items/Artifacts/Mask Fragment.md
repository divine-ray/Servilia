\#Void #Item 

When brought together, any amount of these will fuse together into a full [Vessel Mask](Vessel%20Mask.md), with the seams being filled with the raw abhorrent energy it is driven by (typically taking a red-deep purple swirling shape). 
A vessel may take this cluster of irregular masks to increase it's HP by `amount of shards in the cluster*5+1d4Ã—mask shards`
Found in the proximity of the Fountainhead and floating directly in the Void.

'Easiest' way of accessing these is to raid the Ancient's [Limbo Boneyard](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Hollow%20Mountains\Ancient%20Exile\Limbo%20Boneyard.md).
