A small heart, consisting out of mostly indiscernible mass, and frozen necrotic tissue and biomass. 

It seems to chill the air around it, covering itself with ornate ice crystals. 
Inspecting these crystals instils a sense of dread in the observer.

 

Someone must have taken a tissue sample from the Cold, which shaped itself into this intriguing heart.

Upon contact with the body of any higher organism, may it be dead or alive, it spreads out tendril-like veins, starting to bury itself in the body, shuffling the insides without care to replace the heart. 
 

Capable of modifying the wielder into a closed ecosystem of Cold, dramatically extending their lifespan.
