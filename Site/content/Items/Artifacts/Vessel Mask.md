\#Void 
A mask, carved from bones of a intensively powerful being.
It gives off a deeply unsettling, even eldritch feel.
It is a ivory to bleached white plate, with any number of two to eight holes for eyes. Oftentimes, masks have been engraved or otherwise decorated. 
Despite their origin, they are quite fragile and prone to [shattering](Mask%20Fragment.md).

 In case a hollow or bearer puts it on, they'll find themselves unable to remove it and rapidly decay into a vessel, loosing any free thought and speech.

Main use is to be offered to the [Oblivion Lodge](..\..\Groupings\Cults%20and%20Religions\Oblivion%20Lodge.md), or [The Void](..\..\Realms\Planes\Dark%20Domain\The%20Void.md) directly.
