\#Item 
A red dial-up telephone with a spiral corded receiver.
It appears to not have any connections or cable plugs whatsoever aside one for the receiver. 
Every Morning at 7:30, it rings. If picked up, a frenzied voice attempts to communicate something in hectic mannerisms of a unknown language. Only shortly after, the initial caller is soon overpowered by a deep resonating hum, which one will feel in their bones. It wonâ€™t take long until this hum is overwhelming and one feels forced to hang up. 

Translating this speech is difficult, as the other end is rather hectic, but they [seem to know something](..\..\Overviews\Prophecies.md)...
