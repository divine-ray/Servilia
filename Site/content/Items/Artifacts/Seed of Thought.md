Â 
`Quest Item.`

#### *Player Description:*

A seemingly inert seed from a tree within the Ancient Exile.

##### *Item Lore:*

It is incredibly thought-provoking, and is capable of releasing one's mind from all cultural, social and political restraints.
Many ancient books of empires and royal monarchies express a violent fear of these seeds, as they are almost bound to cause coups or revolutions when sown.
