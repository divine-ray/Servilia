\#Item #Commodity #Component 
"Besides my bed i keep a bottle of dreams..."

Created by placing a [Strange Flask](Strange%20Flask.md) opened in proximity to a resting place. 
It has to be sealed before sunrise, or otherwise the collected dreams will leave again. 

Magic component

Somewhat a amarisk condensate as dreams are unfiltered thoughts
