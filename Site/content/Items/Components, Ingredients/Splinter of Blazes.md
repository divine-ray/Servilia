\#Item #Commodity #Component 
A searing hot splinter, seemingly struck off from a large red gem.
There is a smaller coating of ash sintered onto it.

Despite being extremely hot, you can hold it like any other item.

Someone interested in high temperature applications might find this valuable. 

%%Can be sold to the CoTF, possibly to upgrade bottled embers/smoulders%%
