\#Item #commodity
A decently sized chunk of Gliss, the unnatural substance surrounding the [Fountainhead](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Long%20Savannah\Palga%20Basin\Fountainhead.md).
It is almost entirely devoid of physical traits, which makes samples a white, smooth object with no friction or resistances whatsoever. 

Heavy and unusable in its current state, but someone find this highly valuable.

This cannot be worked with regular tools. (Only magic or Laser/water cutting or magic)
%%
Can be sold to scientists and artisans, as they value its mass in combination to the absolute lack of friction to it.

They are willing to pay a decent commodity for this unspoken substance.
