\#Item #Commodity #Component
Spirit-infused alloy which only is visible during any first quarter to last quarter of the moons or under intense light, which we have not been able to achieve outside of complex focusing optics and the circumstances in a forgery. 

Highly valued and hunted-for amongst assassins and other shady folk that is active at night-time. 
Typically drawn or wrought into fine wire and foil to inscribe secret information aside from it's excellent use in armour plating. 

Only those attuned to the [astral](..\..\Groupings\Cults%20and%20Religions\Lunatics.md) seem to be able to recreate this peculiar substance, with yields best around a triple newmoon. 

Speculated to consist out of dream essence/liquid starlight fused onto hastelloy.
