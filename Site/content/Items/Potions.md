Any "Time of application" is skipped if the container is thrown.

### Utility

Oil of Ironwork (Potion):
This thin oil can cover a 5 foot cube (or equivalent volume) of iron, and takes 10 minutes to apply.  At the end of that time, the volume of raw materials is converted into a cauldron inscribed with alien symbols. The quality of the object is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.

### Defensive

* Grotesque Brew of Plating
  If drank, this clumping ooze will turn the skin of the consumer into bony plates that roughly overlap, distantly mimicking scales. This damages or bursts worn armour or cloth. For the duration of this potion (a day to a week), the consumer has a advantage +8 against pierce/crush/stab damage in the natural armour class. However, the subject has a -3 disadvantage on agility/dexterity. 

### Offensive

* Oil of Nepalese Palm:
  This jelly-like oil can can cover a Medium or smaller creature, and takes 10 minutes to apply.  If a tiny or larger creature touches the affected creature within the next 8 hours, the oil bursts into flames.  Each creature within a 5-foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw.  A target takes 1d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  In any case, this awakens the affected (coated) creature.
* Gaseous Lime
  This light-green gas can be poured from it's container, and will remain static mid-air. It is highly flammable, and already slight differences in temperature cause it to ignite.

### Miscellaneous

* Storyteller's Potion: 
  After drinking this wispy potion, illusory images accompany your speech.
  You do not directly control the illusion, but the images are of creatures, objects, and places you describe, and act as you describe them to. 
  The images never move more than 5 feet away from you, and are purely visual. The effect lasts for as long as you concentrate on it, up to 10 minutes.
