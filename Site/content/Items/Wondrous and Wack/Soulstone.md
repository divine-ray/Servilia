A glass-clear rock, partially encrusted with regular stone. 
A few impurities and cracks stain the sight, which seem to shift by themselves.
It is capable of absorbing the final echo of someoneâ€™s consciousness in the case of a ultimate demise.
It can also be used to chain a [spirit](Spirits) to the material plane for easy recall, or be a beacon and navigation aid to a voluntarily contracted spirit.
