==Wondrous Item==
This small box, coloured black and yellow, features a prominent red knob on top of it, along with the engraved word "**STOP**". 
When the button is pressed, the environment around the activating person is seemingly frozen in time until the button is released, or a subjective minute has passed. 
Time from the perspective of others passes regularly, the activator is just capable of doing a few extremely rapid moves. 

This ability may not be used again until recharged by any means.
