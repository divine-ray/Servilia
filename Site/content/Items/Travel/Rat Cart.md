This sturdy wooden cart is supported by four over-sized treadwheels, each of which contains a magical rat. The cart can carry up to 2000 pounds of weight, and balances itself. It moves at a speed of 40 ft. for up to eight hours per day, but never between midnight to dawn. The cart follows your simple verbal commands to start, stop, turn, etc.
Each rat may be fed[^1] daily for a hour of extra performance. 

[^1]: crickets, grain, travelling supplies, meat,...
