\#Travel
A small stone, worked to resemble a regular geometric shape.
A glowing, fluctuating coloured line runs over the entire stone, dividing it in two halves. One face has the divider widen into what resembles a keyhole, which also takes on another geometric shape.
You obtained a key with it, which fits perfectly into the breach.

It seems to magnetically attract the key...

When the Key is inserted, the divider will vanish, dropping the two shells and open up a temporary rift to any bound location.
Basically acts as a way to quickly return to a place. 
Deft application of these things drastically eases travel, as opening a rift at the target destination back allows for bidirectional traversal.
