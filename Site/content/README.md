### Overview

A slightly oversized and overdone Worldbuilding project, singlehanded-ly done by me. 
Originally designed as D&D(ish) + Home-brew setting, has expanded out and beyond that ever since. 
There's little understandable or coherent, linked story going on, since my interests are more in the entire overarching environment and such. But you'll find some texts that are from the point of view of a individual, who might become a persistent character. Who knows.[^1]
[Towards the Reader](WIP%20or%20Projects\Workpieces\Towards%20the%20Reader.md).

### Themes

There’s no consistent theme aside from “the world is horrible yet we keep on pushing” and issues arising from that, so, have fun! 
**In terms of genres and bullet points this project includes:**

* Computer- and machine-centric fiction (Primarily in the Third Era)
  * Cyberpunk, related digital concepts 
* Steampunk and derivatives seen in the worship of the Mechanical God
  * Somewhat own interpretation of steampunk and such
    * represented in Thylyist of the Second Era
* A mostly-fleshed out magic system
* 40-60%ish Mapped out continent with regional oddities and such
  * Read [Locations and You](Overviews\Summaries\Locations%20and%20You.md) for such. 
* Themes of modifying life
  * Through Technology, = augmentation
  * Through Magic, = Sarkicism/Nolkan practices
* Not to forget, various dystopian/grim-dark views of the world
* [Universal Pantheon](Overviews\Summaries\Universal%20Pantheon.md) of Deities who rose after the [Death of Divinity](Overviews\Concepts\Theophagy.md). 

### Starting To Read

Start here: 

* [Faction Overview](Overviews\Summaries\Faction%20Overview.md)
* [Things that Need Fixing](Overviews\Summaries\Things%20that%20Need%20Fixing.md)
* If careless about spoilers: [Major Plotlines](Overviews\Summaries\Major%20Plotlines.md)

* For the magic system, consider reading around [Twilit](Realms\Planes\Twilit.md) and [Twilit Casting](Overviews\Concepts\Magic%20System\Twilit%20Casting.md). 
* Lifeforms and species are described in [Species of Servilia](Overviews\Summaries\Species%20of%20Servilia.md). 
* The files in the WIP or Projects/Workpieces directory are mostly texts sourced from sudden inspiration, and those are the most coherent in terms of action. 
* [Regarding the Planets and Star](WIP%20or%20Projects\Workpieces\Regarding%20the%20Planets%20and%20Star.md) explains the current state of the solar system. 

### Timeline

A coherent story/timeline is yet to come. 
However, the History of Servilia (The name of this continent) can roughly be divided into "The Past", "The Present" and "The Future".
Read [The First Era](History\Eras\The%20First%20Era\The%20First%20Era.md), [The Second Era](History\Eras\The%20Second%20Era\The%20Second%20Era.md) and *The Third Era* respectively. 
They're also available at [Human Eras](History\Eras\Human%20Eras.md) due to two or so other sentient species existing, but nothing from their point of view is documented (yet). 

### Misc

So far, the #Overviews tag should be pretty self-explanatory and helpful. 

For best reading experience, I highly advocate [Obsidian]([https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)) as editor/reader, since it enables various widely-used features like file links, tags and alike. 

Various other things exist here as well due to me using this as Notepad, but you're better off ignoring it. 

[^1]: Because I don't. This is the nature of this entire project; ever-changing, ever-shifting.
