(As of 6/5/22)
(for the playing party)
[Darb ut-Tabānah](..\..\Beings\Gods%20and%20Deities\Celestial%20Family\Darb%20ut-Tab%C4%81nah.md) has recently been seen travelling the realm (despite being claimed dead), heading towards Thylyist.

~~He aims towards the Thylyian Government to exploit their fear towards the arcane and use it to finally deal with the fountainhead~~.

The Party could set on that rumour and try to catch the proclaimed-dead Ancient and to interrogate them.

~~If that doesn't happen,Darb ut-Tabānah will sneak into the Thylyian government and do things to get them towards the Fountainhead~~.

 > 
 > In case the above takes place, he'll publish materials to guide adventurers and such towards the Fountainhead, massively destabilising the Thylyian society because "ooo magic spooky"
