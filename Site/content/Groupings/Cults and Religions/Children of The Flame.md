\#Children-of-the-Flame #Cult 
 

The children of the flame, worshippers of the flaming *Crimson Heart* feeding on sacrificed Amarisk (precisely the burst of Amarisk released on death).
The bodies or physical appearance of the higher up cultists get slowly undergoes pyrolysis/cremation into animate figures of ashes.

They are on their way to developing a solution to the [Curse of the Undead](..\..\Overviews\Concepts\Curse%20of%20the%20Undead.md) by restoring the embers of life and motivation within them through the fire they wield, which they rarely sell to the highest bidder. 
However, the majority of their ranks have become twisted and warped, aiming at misconducted "purification" through incineration of the poor undying instead, causing them a horrible reputation. 
The only faction capable of producing [Bottled Embers](..\..\Items\Bottled%20Embers.md), [Splinter of Blazes](..\..\Items\Components,%20Ingredients\Splinter%20of%20Blazes.md) and [Bottled Smoulders](..\..\Items\Bottled%20Smoulders.md).

A sign of progressing cremation is the loss of a functional endoskeleton, which usually is "celebrated" by a full 360° turn of the head.

Ashen ones are quite allergic and disliking towards water since it screws up their entire body and shape.

Archenemy towards [The Cold](..\Factions\The%20Cold.md) and the \[\[, despite being all-too-similar.
