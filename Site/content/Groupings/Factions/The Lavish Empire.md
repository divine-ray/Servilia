# Profile: #Lavish

This water-bound species shaped the once-dry [Palga Basin](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Long%20Savannah\Palga%20Basin\Palga%20Basin.md) into a massive body of water, sustaining their life.
Settled within [Syksa, Lavish Capital](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Long%20Savannah\Palga%20Basin\Syksa,%20Lavish%20Capital.md). 

### Decscription of the Species:

Lavish were sentient and crafty descendants of molluscs (squid, octopi) that called highly oxygenated, clear waters their home.
They primarily fed on aquatic microorganisms (\<1cm) and rarely off black smoker ecosystems.
Through the superior dexterity gained by their tentacles, this species has mastered both magic and conventional technology and was capable of fusing those into [artificial life](..\..\Beings\Species\Pseudoneo.md).

### Communication

Their primary means of communication were telepathy and changing the colour of their skin. Secondarily is the ejection of a pheromone and ink mixture that acts as longer term messages.
A breakthrough in their development has been the development of implants that allow coordinated long distance communication.

Ever since their primordial ancestors, these beings were highly competent with biology and a relic of old times were symbiotic relations to bacteria cultures that enable their bioluminescence.
Adult individuals each fostered a colony of bacteria and other microbiological life, which define a unique signature to others and enable them to transmit complex, self-propagating messages.

It is speculated that they could only advance so far due to the water shielding them from the intense solar emission, which likely complicates [Empire of Thylyist](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Areas\Empire%20of%20Thylyist\Empire%20of%20Thylyist.md) sciences.

## Technology and Magic

The Lavish were responsible for building the [Fountainhead](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Long%20Savannah\Palga%20Basin\Fountainhead.md).
They wielded great arcane powers and bonded to the twilight, until they constructed the Fountainhead and tore a hole into the [Twilit](..\..\Realms\Planes\Twilit.md).

They engineered most of the [transport systems](Argrosy.md) in Thylyist and Servilia.

### Supercollider Antimatter power project::

\#locations #Lavish 

***S***uper-***c***ollider ***A***nti-***m***atter power project
Lavish-built super-collider with four major cylindrical towers for stabilisation
Multitudes (256) of automated cooling ports placed around the ring, which pop up once a day to gather atmospheric nitrogen and dump accumulated heat
â†’ mysterious rock movement and heat deaths
It's still[^1] in operation and fully maintained by [Pseudoneo](..\..\Beings\Species\Pseudoneo.md) entities, which are highly valued by scavengers
The [Automated Remains > Vents](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Areas\Locations\Automated%20Remains.md#vents) and towers are overgrown and concealed with rock, soil and plants, but they're somewhat noisy (but most beings don't perceive this noise yet avoid them still)

The collision chamber is built under [Londo](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Hollow%20Mountains\Ancient%20Exile\Londo.md) as safety measure.
The SC-AM project is top secret and partially outfitted with antimemetics.

Its power signature eventually got discovered by Amidan Scientists, so its power output quickly got redirected after the Fountainhead was dealt with. 

[^1]: including Amidan future

So, the lavish people had created Rapture (BioShock) x Fallout Vaults
