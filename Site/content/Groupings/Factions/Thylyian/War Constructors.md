### Overview

The specialised brigade of the [Gearforged Vanguard](Gearforged%20Vanguard.md), unshackled from the regressive preachings of the Mekhanites. 
Tasked to channel His Design into machines that kill, maim and burn, this ward holds the responsibility of many-a such creations, reckless and carefree of the impact of their monstrosities.  ^87a079

### People involved

Despite being among the highest secrets of Thylyist, one or two names slipped into the general public.
It is known that [War Constructor Borange Olbaz](..\..\..\Beings\Characters%20and%20People\Thylyian\War%20Constructor%20Borange%20Olbaz.md) is among their highest ranks.
