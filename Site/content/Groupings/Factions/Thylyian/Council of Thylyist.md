\#Thylyist 
Once the shining example of democracy, this institution has been overthrown after the [Betrayal](..\..\..\History\Incidents%20and%20Events\Betrayal.md).
Ever since, the [Followers of Mekhane](..\..\Cults%20and%20Religions\Followers%20of%20Mekhane.md) reign with a [iron fist](Gearforged%20Vanguard.md), thwarting any opposition and anything that could possibly threaten their reign. 
The council of seven individuals governing the City Empire of Thylyist. 
They are seen as ethereal and incorporeal from the population.
Members of the council are very rarely seen in persona and they employ life-extending technology.
Every 16 orbital periods of Heaugi (16op x 64d/op = 1024d) ,they hold a secret vote if one member has become untrustworthy and requires *replacements*. 
A replacement is selected from a pool of unknowing citizens.
[But their reign is flimsy, and bound to fall and burn.](..\..\..\Overviews\Possible%20Ways%20Thylyist%20can%20collapse.md)
They always use code names or those that don’t change.

 > Plottwist: [Darb ut-Tabānah](..\..\..\Beings\Gods%20and%20Deities\Celestial%20Family\Darb%20ut-Tab%C4%81nah.md), a exilian (he got exiled from the other deities) is now betraying and traitorous towards the other deities and pushes the government to act upon the issue of magic, especially the fountainhead, and ancients.

###### Old Stuff

It works similar to the O5 council, 7 anonymous and identity-cleansed "immortals" that do stuff

The Administrator is actually a halfbreed of god and dragon and the only one who's capable and knowing of magic in Thylyist
