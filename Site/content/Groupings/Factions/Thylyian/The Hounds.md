Elite hit squad in the [Thylyian Military](..\..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Areas\Empire%20of%20Thylyist\Central%20Thylyist%20Armoury.md), solely consisting from captured [Pseudoneo](..\..\..\Beings\Species\Pseudoneo.md) quadrupeds from past the [Betrayal](..\..\..\History\Incidents%20and%20Events\Betrayal.md). 
Their handlers are under direct control and obey to the [Dogs of War](Dogs%20of%20War.md). 

They are *extremely* violent, or rather, have been abused and trained to be so, and are stored within a own high-security sector in the Armory. 
Likely the second-highest secret of the Thylyian Military, if not **the** highest.
