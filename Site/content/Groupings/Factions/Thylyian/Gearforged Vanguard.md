*Strategic Planning and Coordination Department*
The Thylyian Military, led by a small group of wealthy and otherwise influential people, including city-famous merchant guild leaders or [Mekhanites](..\..\Cults%20and%20Religions\Followers%20of%20Mekhane.md). 
More-so the collection of the [Mekhanite](..\..\Cults%20and%20Religions\Followers%20of%20Mekhane.md) Priests and devotees, which use the military as means to zealotry and religious imperialism and enforcement. Partisans are highly valued within their council, and trained. 

Their position of power allows them to evade their own stigmata against magic, so the highest-ranking within this already-peaking group violate their own sermons and turned to the [True Machinists](..\..\Cults%20and%20Religions\True%20Machinists.md) for extending their lifespan. 
Execution/elimination of individuals that turn unfavourable or suspicious is common, and a favourite way of ridding someone is falling out of windows. 

## Organisation, Hierarchy

### 1. The *High Conclave*

... Has been in power since the *Fall of the Lavish*, is to blame for the events of [The Second Era](..\..\..\History\Eras\The%20Second%20Era\The%20Second%20Era.md).
The highest unit of command and power in the Military. 
Most significant, those cover up the extinction of the Lavish, the propaganda and doctrine (against the arcane), and the techno-cultural regression and isolation/fortification. 

### 2. Dogs of War

Elite unit of trades- and businessmen, sourced from *Merchant Guild*s and the [Labor Union of Thylyist](Labor%20Union%20of%20Thylyist.md).

Under direct rule of Thylyian government and [Military](Gearforged%20Vanguard.md#officially-strategic-planning-and-coordination-department), and central to Thylyist economy. Well-funded. 
Has been repeatedly tasked to assault [Frisco](..\..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Areas\Frisco%20Bay\Frisco.md)'s economy, as they're the only notable competitor.

### 3. [War Constructors](War%20Constructors.md)

### Overview

The specialised brigade of the [Gearforged Vanguard](Gearforged%20Vanguard.md), unshackled from the regressive preachings of the Mekhanites. 
Tasked to channel His Design into machines that kill, maim and burn, this ward holds the responsibility of many-a such creations, reckless and carefree of the impact of their monstrosities.  ^87a079

### People involved

Despite being among the highest secrets of Thylyist, one or two names slipped into the general public.
It is known that [War Constructor Borange Olbaz](..\..\..\Beings\Characters%20and%20People\Thylyian\War%20Constructor%20Borange%20Olbaz.md) is among their highest ranks.
