Post-Revolution [Empire of Thylyist](..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Areas\Empire%20of%20Thylyist\Empire%20of%20Thylyist.md) which caused major turnovers in cultural and social norms, which led to a very liberal but unstable culture and population.
The downfall (and execution) of most of the [Council of Thylyist](Factions\Thylyian\Council%20of%20Thylyist.md) also lifted the veil that propaganda was shaping around magic and the outside world

* Huge leaps in technological development due to incorporated \[Lavish\](The Lavish Empire) technology salvages and the beginning of *Arcane Engineering* and artificial life sciences (in human culture)
  With the newfound expertise and drive they sought out to finally handle the [Fountainhead](..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Long%20Savannah\Palga%20Basin\Fountainhead.md) in a deal with the [Twilit](..\Realms\Planes\Twilit.md)
  → some alternative link to empower 'our' (the material) world

The government is de-facto [controlled by Corporations](Amida\Board%20of%20Amida-Seven.md), which neglected civil protection and law enforcement for most of their reign, which led to chaos, *Organised Crime* and very liberal individual rights and downfall of most hesitations (i.e. it is common to walk barely nude, or barely tolerated to engage in sex on the open). 
Crime gangs empowered themselves to be the second government, mostly unscathed and otherwise dodging the feeble and underfunded the attempts of the corporations. 
Poverty is common, and food is scarce. 

[Ancients](Factions\Ancients.md) got unexiled (probably) due to [Fountainhead](..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Long%20Savannah\Palga%20Basin\Fountainhead.md) modifications 
[Lavish](..\Beings\Species\Lavish.md) technology (re-)enabled the modification of life, which led to the stereotypical implant culture of cyberpunk scenarios and to extremely durable semiorganic creatures, which got used to erect the space elevator in the centre of Sector 9

* intense space colonialism with the capability of easy space-faring
* possibly discovered a \[Lavish\](The Lavish Empire) colony within [Heaugi](..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Heaugi.md)'s oceans, who are defending their refuge with extreme means and violence

Amida as megacity has lifted the Thylyian dogma against non-human[^1] sentience, but ghettos and racism is still a daily issue and major source of criminality.
*Varuú* people still reside in their busted society in the Ninth Forest, but some deviants (Dark elves?) moved to Amida.

#### \#Amida 
Big if not titanic organic and sentient supercomputers that search for a solution to the [Curse of the Undead](..\Overviews\Concepts\Curse%20of%20the%20Undead.md). Their entire structure houses a sector each, as they govern infrastructure. 
Numerators were able to interact with the control of the [SC-AM](..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Long%20Savannah\Palga%20Basin\SC-AM.md) project and tap the power output for [Amida](Amida.md).
Most of the heat produced is absorbed by purposed [The Cold](Factions\The%20Cold.md) tissue to recuperate energy and not to devastate the environment like Rainworld.

Modified Cold tissue has been tamed to form transport pathways throughout each Numerator structure; Strands and bundles of neurons, veins and other capillary paths facilitate most matter and information (including civilian) transport within each numerator.
General population is aware of the rough task of the numerators but they don't really care other than for housing and *utilities*. 

As each Numerator is sentient, they shifted and changed their structure to reflect and express themselves, which contributed to the erratic and organic looks of Amida as whole. 
Each Sector/Numerator has grown and accustomed to a specific populace group or thematic scheme which correlates to their personality. 
Each numerator possesses an avatar, which is usually entrapped within its chamber. Avatars outside their chamber are rarely seen, and oftentimes carry a prophetical gossip as it means that this numerator was not able to ‘remotely’ solve the problem at hand. 

The collective of Numerators is possibly scheming a coup or other way to rid of the corporate board.

## Sectors, as divided by Numerator:

* *Amida-5* is the government/corporate HQ and management
  Control
* *Amida-8*  is the synth^\[read:android, pseudoneo\] ghetto
  Regrets for Newborn
* *Amida-9* is the Space elevator and [Mass transit hub.](Organisations\Argrosy.md)
  Icarus
* *Amida-11* is the accumulation sector of furries. 
  Alteration
* [Amida-12](..\WIP%20or%20Projects\TO-DO\Amida-12.md) is centred around brothels, clubs and other institutions of pleasure. 
  Desire 
  Numerators not integrated into the collective^\[The corporate-associated numerators are seen as inferior, as they're severely restrained in their degrees of freedom.\]
* *A-5b*
  [APAS Ltd.](Amida\APAS%20Ltd..md) HQ, R&D, Testing and Deployment 
* *A-5c'a*
  *protoGen Industrial Group* HQ, Fabrication and R&D

Furries (sapient anthropomorphic humanoids) exist in *Amida-8* due to a leak that involved the full genome of all major humanoid species and instructions to modify it, which led to a subset of rippers that went all-in and modified humanoid genomes, partly resulting in abominations, but also creating furries.

Addresses are given in XYZ coordinates of that sector relative to the numerator core (0|0|0)
