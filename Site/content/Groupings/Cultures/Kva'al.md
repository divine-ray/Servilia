Kva'al is the independent Community of Dragonkin, residing on the upper half of [Ka√°-Rav](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Sea%20Major\Astral%20Ocean\Ka%C3%A1-Rav%20Isles\Ka%C3%A1-Rav.md), around the *Right Ribs* and [Hollow Mountains](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Hollow%20Mountains\Hollow%20Mountains.md). 
During the [The Second Era](..\..\History\Eras\The%20Second%20Era\The%20Second%20Era.md), most full-blood dragons have more or less been forcibly moved to here, as the Thylyist martial law ruined the reputation of dragonkin. 

Their densest settlement is [Skalitz](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Sea%20Major\Astral%20Ocean\Ka%C3%A1-Rav%20Isles\Skalitz.md).
