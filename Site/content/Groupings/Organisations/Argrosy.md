\#Lavish 
A network of subterranean high-speed trains, driven by isolated power sources. 
The Lavish built this state-of-the-art transport network in a effort to bring the civilisations of Servilia closer together. For their time, they performed rather well, and were maintained by the first few prototypes of Pseudoneo, which ensue the theoretical function to the current day. 

Elemental spirits of air and motion were contracted to reside in the machinery of these trains as drive and energy source, which makes them nearly independent in terms of fuel or material use. 

With a proper effort and organisation it might be feasible to restore these trains. 
In the current state, the tunnels are flooded with water, making it impossible to use them for via foot travel. The few people who study the remains of the Lavish have speculated that the trains are cylindrical carriages driven by a set of tentacles and water jets, given the current flooding. 

Notable locations in possession of a Argrosy station are:
