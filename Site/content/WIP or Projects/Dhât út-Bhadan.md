The Tree of Knowledge. 
Home to *Leonis*, the Librarian. 
This tree houses several thousand if not tens of thousands of books and other written media. It considered a place of pilgrimage to many mages and alike due to the extensive knowledge on any subject available here. 
The resident tree spirit, *Dhât*, and Leonis are both formal members in the [Erudition Coven](..\Groupings\Organisations\Erudition%20Coven.md).

Alongside the extensive library present here, Leonis also tends to his other hobby: Tea. -
