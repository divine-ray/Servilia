\#Structure #TODO 
the old one was getting too crammed for my own comfort so here we are

I’m going to handle this more of a random drafting page than anything, for the time being

# Charon

The ferryman Charon, he who transfers the souls of the deceased, was rendered unable to execute his job (somehow).
so I’m assuming it is in relation to god-became nolka in cooperation with a group of varuu that they managed to either incapacitate Charon or his boat or the rivers Styx and Acheron.
(Styx is the river that connects the material plane to the `cosmic foam`, and Acheron springs from the end of Styx into the afterlives.)

 > There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast –  
 > A sordid god: down from his hairy chin  
 > A length of beard descends, uncombed, unclean;  
 > His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire;  
 > A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire.

%%SICK Illusions and Club Kink?%%
%%Sinister Oasis of Kinky Delights?%%
%%Sinful Indulgence Club & Kink%%
The club-brothel-community in [Amida-12](Amida-12.md), harbouring a very lax and liberal group of mutually-understanding nymphomaniacs and similar odd folks. 
The Avatar of A-12 is inclined towards SICK and therefore protects the organisation and its properties, albeit without much care. 

This is where we live, turning sin into virtue, committing to the lifestyle. 
Give up your restraints, live your little life to it's fullest. 
There is so much you could do, yet you choose to waste it with unpleasantries. 

One of the more influential organisations within A-12, as it owns a fair segment of housing and *entertainment* spaces alike.
Stained with a **sick**ly sweet reputation among A-12, as their elusive services has gained them prestigious remarks. 

Primarily catering towards kinky fur folk and synth life, inherently gate-keeping towards commonfolk. 
Quite protective and subjectively safe compared to other, similar institutions around A-12.
Oftentimes recruits and hires volunteers for some stability in their life in some action of "welfare", granting them housing from the club-owned flats. 

The dance floor, poles and other set-pieces of performing are regularly scheduled to be a canvas of free expression towards visitors and residents alike. 

This place must seem utmost bizarre and nigh-disgusting to outsiders, as local residents and visitors all exchange on lusty and flirty ways.

## Location & Interior

## Beyond the Pale Veil

possibly the utuw system is enclosed or wrapped in a Dyson sphere by a unknown actor?
or to contain something considered malicious?

## Dunestriders

clay vessels, covered and possibly filled with mire and tar. origin unknown, yet they wander the dunes of the long savannah and sandy areas. oftentimes found in large herds, like flocks of sheep and cattle, but without their shepherd. 
never inspected up close as their massive apothecaries, held high up by strands of tar, instil dread and fear towards local folks and oftentimes cause them to move or flee.

*Just open the door.*
