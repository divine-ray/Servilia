Simply put: The *Nølkā* *devoured* [Charon](..\..\Beings\Gods%20and%20Deities\Charon.md), and therefore all mechanisms related to Dying faltered and stopped. 

The *Nølkā-Mekhanite War* eventually made the *Nølkā* use their last retreat, something that massively alters human biology through a pathogen-imbued-with-magic, which eventually evolved into the Curse of Undying, furthering Schi ut-Pula's depression, which left the Twilight orphaned and amplified the entire situation.
