*red plague* is the original ancestor of both [Heart of Cold](..\..\Beings\Heart%20of%20Cold.md) and *Crimson Heart* since it's the first organism to assimilate other biomass and inorganic matter. 
it mostly consists out of globs of godawful writhing flesh, all being independent and autonomous on their own, but the complexity alone won't go beyond primordial self sustaining and defense. 
together, masses can achieve coordination and varying degrees of reasoning and memory.
