 > TIL about Philipp Mainländer a philosopher who theorised that *God* committed suicide and His decaying corpse is the living universe, and since God was an infinite being the only way He could kill himself was to shatter His timeless being into a time-bound and material universe.

Ranging under the assumption that the Nolkan hunger for godly beings did not destroy/disable everything, might have some [Old Gods](..\..\Beings\Gods%20and%20Deities\Old%20Gods.md) left untouched, amused at their cabals. 

The Death of God has the *Angels* left without directions to their own devices.
