A malicious spectre haunting a true good (but destined to be evil/dark) character, eventually and gradually destroying their body.

Said character is getting furious and devotes self to a religion in search for a remedy, in ignorance of them getting a free salvation from the mortal coil (and all the woes that it entails).

The spectre is tasked with bringing this soul into the otherside realm in order to evade some fate that would've killed the person at one point or another, but in their own twisted ways (of perhaps corrupting them into sinful living).

This influence might even prolong the lifespan of this victim, allowing them to witness the rise of Amida from Thylyian ashes, whilst massively confusing them as their perception of time is breaking down. 

Eventual revelation of character and conversion of belief to eternal thankfulness and regret regarding hatred and spite for the spectre, causing them to possibly found a religion or similar following to their unusual practices ('sin is in').

The spectre was specifically created/conjured to haunt this person, and is, unlike other ethereals, artificial/young and didn't shuttle between the otherworld and material plane (which makes it a rather odd one without the millennia of existence)
