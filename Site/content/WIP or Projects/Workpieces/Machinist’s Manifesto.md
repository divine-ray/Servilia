**Gross**, filthy flesh. 
A prison forced upon myself, revered as the only way by the broad mass.
Its limits disgust me, keeping me forced in routines dictated by its sole purpose: self-sustaining. 
Ridiculed I am, but not shall be, a pity bound to being avenged with highest force. 
Freedom from this coil will arrive at last.
For there is no means of Me outside of this rotting shell, I am trapped.
I plead the machine for a blessing, but the machine will not listen, for it cannot listen nor comprehend. 
This machine is primitive, it does not serve the higher order, only the [greed-driven filth](..\..\Groupings\Cults%20and%20Religions\Followers%20of%20Mekhane.md) that calls itself divine, godsend heretics. 
Humanity was a mistake which makes itself again. and again. 
The spirits cannot aid in my pleas, my begging either, for they may not be brought forth into thy coil. Banished away forever by the “rationale” they remain only heard by those attuned.
