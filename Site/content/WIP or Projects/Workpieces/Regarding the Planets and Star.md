%%I puzzled this together at 1am, forgive me%%
Most of the present solar system is polished to the degree where I need it to be, with the planet and it's three moons having the most attention.

Any other planet has only been named and described through what is visible using simpler optics, ie existing technology.

Schi, the main, earthlike planet itself, is only described on one continent since the residents of this continent named Servilia can't leave [Edge of Hope](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Sea%20Major\Edge%20of%20Hope.md).
In summary, there's a phenomenon that forbids naval and aerial travellers to trespass a invisible border.
It is simply too much work for me to create and maintain more continents, all with trying-to-be unique cultures and whatnot.
Therefore, only one continent, but if you so have thematically fitting ideas, please let me know.
