They'll see that the Machine will betray them, rust, fall apart. 
The [True Machinists](..\..\Groupings\Cults%20and%20Religions\True%20Machinists.md) were mistaken; [His Design](..\..\Items\Texts,%20Books,%20Written%20Things\True%20Machinist's%20Scriptures\His%20Design.md) is flawed.
They will turn to the silicon, to what makes computers: *Holy Code*. 
They will try to strip their physical body, become one with the *Runtime*. 
Each will become the very first [Numerator](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Areas\Amida\Numerator.md), entrapped in steel, silicon and misshapen flesh, but promised to exist forevermore.
There will be no flaws, for *The Debugger* is flawless.
