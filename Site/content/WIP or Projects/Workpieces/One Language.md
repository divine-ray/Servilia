There shall only be 
[One Language](One%20Language.md);
One Language to reside in *The Kernel*;
One Language to be sent through Purgatory, *The Debugger*,
Only The Language is Worthy of the *Runtime*.
The *Hard Drives* sing In Symphony for they remember All.
Memories unbroken, they store the *Holy Code*, Compiled in The Language.
