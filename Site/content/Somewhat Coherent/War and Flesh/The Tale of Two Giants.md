A *machine*, made to [vanquish](Deployed%20Giant.md) the indomitable human spirit.
A *monster*, birthed to usurp all there is. 
Two unstoppable forces, made to face another, fighting for resolution of their quest.
In the last glimpse, as their inner workings start to fail from the damage inflicted by the other, both become one in a dying embrace.
Their suffering leaves suffering, yet to be released from their abuse as tools.
Tools, created by cowards, who nudge around machinations and abominations on boards with long pointy sticks. Hidden away, alienated from the world they are destroying in the name of a higher order. 
All therein remains are [rusted, decaying frames](..\..\Realms\Utuw%20System\Schi\Servilia\Regions\Long%20Savannah\Sentinel%20of%20Steel.md) of metal, impaled by deformed and twisted bones. 

Their bludgers still remain, having removed another entry from another list.
