The veil of fog below, I want to pierce it. What are they hiding in there?
But you, yes, things have changed. We now have wings. Fouling ones, at that, but we can try.
The railing is a easy obstacle to throw. 
The railing is ripped out of it's aged sockets and bolts, and now falling down the gap.
It is out of sight now. 
Will we make the jump?
Pacing about on the catwalk, no longer guarded by a allusion of safety.
