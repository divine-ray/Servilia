The [[Nølkā]] and [[Followers of Mekhane|Mekhanites]] are inspired, and mostly based off, the SCP Wiki Community. 
For the present moment (12.03.2024), the [[Oneiroi Collective]] is also named after the SCP Wiki Group Of Interest.

I do not intend to plagiarise or otherwise claim these as truly my ideas; their original conception, attribution and IP belongs to the authors of the SCP Wiki.

I do not claim any listed works in [[References]] as my own nor do I (intend to) capitalise upon them, they only serve a role as inspiration.
Most of this project boils down as a amalgam and combination of many media influences, and purposes as a overarching canon to unify many works of art and other media.   ^f2df94
