Manifestation of [[Amarisk]], coagulation of thought, condensed cognition. Source of energies and potential to mages and spellcasters through deliberate actions.
Occasionally manifests [[Echoes]] and other supernatural phenomena, oftentimes scaping or rearranging a local landscape.  
It is never directly seen, but its effects are always noticeable on the material plane. 

Writhing in agony, tormented for eternity with its gross, rotting gore, with no healing in sight, all due to the [[Fountainhead]]. For this, it seeks vengeance against it’s^[*read: the fountainheads*] creators and origins, the Lavish. 

Human shared conscious divided it into seven layers, which may be traversed using protection. Attempting traversal without sufficient protection and safety will lead to a unpleasant and horrible demise. 
Each layer resembles it’s previous layer, deteriorating in the process. The first layer is almost akin to our world. 
Rare controversy, labelled heresy, doubted the concept of seven rigid layers, and implied a space [[Between]].
The decay happens in a conceptual and reversing matter, that being the reduction into mere concepts and their sketches, or the return to natural shapes and materials. 
At the bottom of all layers lays [[The Void]]. 
 
The entire Chaos caused by the dysfunctional FH is the Between leaking and seeping without any [[Fountainhead Catalyst|Catalyst and filtration]], and the twilight itself is indirectly amplifying the power of Between.
