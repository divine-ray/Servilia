*Note: This refers to the location, for the Entity associated, read [[Voidfish]].*
At the bottom of the [[Twilit]] it lays, stretching into infinity. 
Due to the [[Fountainhead]] having torn its [[The Abyss|Borehole]],  it leaks into the material plane. 

Supposedly only [[Vessels]] or hollows can stay here without being torn apart or going insane.
Hollows quickly turn into vessels when contacting the Void.

The counteracting force to all that is matter, therefore archenemy to [[Schi ut-Pula]] and all other celestial entities.
