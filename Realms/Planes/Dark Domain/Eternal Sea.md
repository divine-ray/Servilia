This Plane, or rather, parallel Realm, is the space within celestial bodies. It is not easily traversed, and hostile towards life. 
Few forays have been made into this space, and have proven very harsh and cost-expensive.
The concept of reaching for the vast nothingness has been considered heretical, if not plain lunatic. 

Defying terms of physics, this space refuses to be treated as three-dimensional space, but rather as infinite flat plane, emanating from wherever the observer attempts to foray into it. 
This phenomenon led wordsmiths and bards alike to treat it as ocean, which became its namesake of the eternal sea in common conscious and culture. 
The relative movement of Schi as point of observation in relation to the few stars present led to metaphors of glowing fishes and such in said ocean. 
The [[Astral Ocean]] only amplified this entire perception, as the galaxy and other formations appear like reflections of light in a rippling water surface.o
