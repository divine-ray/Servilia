The last bastions of the pure [[Old Mekhane Faith]], untouched by the violent and deluded ideals of the so-called [[Followers of Mekhane]]. Spread across the continent and settled in the most extreme corners, they continue on with their studies and worship of their god, bitter knowing He is long gone. Bitter they continue in their studies and worships, some monasteries actively planning to topple the Council, to reclaim His Heart and Spirit. 

Yet they remain, knowing that the Follower‘s doings are prone to failure, bound to repeat their own grave mistakes. 
Despite their bitterness and resent-fuelled spite, some convents have adopted rather modern and tolerant practices, with [[five ]]select ones sheltering [[Songbird|Songbirds]] as messengers. These five are the origin of the [[True Machinists]], serving as their operating bases and shelters.
