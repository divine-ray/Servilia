Out there in the fields 
	stands a shack
Or what remains of it.
Torn by the winds and weathers, 
It barely stands. 
It is what testifies of what was here before,
A long time ago. 
A village, flourishing, yet so little. 
That was once, now all there remains is grain and this
Shack, in which someone stores their tools.  
They donâ€™t know what happened, they only care about
The corn. 
Even if they were to care
There would be nothing to find
No foundations, no skeletons, no rotting bodies or wood. 
Only remembrance and the dying spirit of the [[Ohrthyrst|city]], 
driven into the shack like 
a hunted animal.
