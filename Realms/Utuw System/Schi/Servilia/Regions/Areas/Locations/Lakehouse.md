*A big, chaotically built mansion, towering over the nearby lake.*
*It emanates a warm and homely feel. Maybe you want to come inside?*

*Upon casting a spell or working magic within:*
> Something is off... you don't feel the usual exhaustion coming with magic.
> What was that?
> Did the floor panels just... flap?

Built next and over to a small lake, with wooden struts and stone pillars holding the twined building stable. 
It's build on a strong, almost untouched, nigh raw stone foundation.

Closer inspection reveals that every material is in a similar state to the foundation, seemingly directly put into place without further manufacturing.

This place is so familiar, yet feels wrong in its entirety; as if wood, rock and loam fused and grew together anew. Yet it is missing pieces: bricks gone, entire rocks missing, logs growing into trees where lumber would be. 

This mansion or house was built long ago by now long [[Varuú|forgotten noble people]].
They seem to had powerful knowledge over arcane architecture, as the entire building seems to be capable of sensing its environment and inhabitants.

Why does it feel so familiar? Did I/we/you use to live here? 
Won’t you stay here, with me, my darling?

Across the sea, from over the pier reaching into the water, I spot a tall figure in a boat, seemingly adrift. They are one to carry a weighty bag, through which i spot movement. At the blink of my eyes the boat is set asunder, an i fear the well-being of this man and his ominous cargo. I long to reach to him, lest I cannot, for he is leagues away.
