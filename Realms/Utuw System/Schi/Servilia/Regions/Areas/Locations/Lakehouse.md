*A big, chaotically built mansion, towering over the nearby lake.*
*It emanates a warm and homely feel. Maybe you want to come inside?*

*Upon casting a spell or working magic within:*
> Something is off... you don't feel the usual exhaustion coming with magic.
> What was that?
> Did the floor panels just... flap?

Built next to a small lake, with wooden struts and stone pillars holding the twined building stable. Parts of the foundation reach into the water, held by aforementioned supports. Some upper floors seem to arch over the water, as if they want to take a bath. 
It's build on a strong, almost untouched, nigh raw stone foundation.

Closer inspection reveals that every material is in a similar state to the foundation, seemingly directly put into place without further manufacturing or treatment. 

This place is so familiar, yet feels wrong in its entirety; as if wood, rock and loam fused and grew together anew. Yet it is missing pieces: bricks gone, entire rocks missing, logs growing into trees where lumber would be. 

This mansion or house was built long ago by now long [[Vaaruú|forgotten noble people]].
They seem to had powerful knowledge over arcane architecture, as the entire building seems to be capable of sensing its environment and inhabitants.

Why does it feel so familiar? Did `I/we/you` use to live here? 
Won’t you stay here, with me, my darling?

Across the sea, from over the pier reaching into the water, I spot a tall figure in a boat, seemingly adrift. They are one to carry a weighty bag, through which I spot movement. At the blink of my eyes the boat is set asunder, an i fear the well-being of this man and his ominous cargo. I long to reach to him, lest I cannot, for he is leagues away.
