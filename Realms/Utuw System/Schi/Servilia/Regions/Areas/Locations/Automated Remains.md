Various buildings and structures left around the continent by [someone long gone](The%20Lavish%20Empire.md). 
Recent studies and research with scholars and experts of the field have dated these to [[Before the First Era]]. 
Most of them remain functional through the maintenance of [peculiar critters](Pseudoneo) and other creatures, which [I](Kookie,%20Mage) did not inspect closer yet. 
In this entry I will summarise the most notable ones i found repeatedly, and theorise their function. 
## Gun Installation
This impossible-to-deceive turret hoists one to four massive cannon barrels, each longer than a man, each with a bigger diameter of my head. 
Atop the barrel array usually sits a metal sphere, through which's oculus a blind eye gazes at me.
It seems to chase after [light sources](Flare), and will attempt to turn the turret towards any light source it can see, but this usually fails due to the rotten machinery.
The smell of what I believe to be leaking blood mixed with oil is pungent, and hurts my nose. 
Almost all of them are somehow shrouded to their best extend in the local landscape, spare for the huge protruding cannon barrel(s).
## Vents
A device apparently rooted into the earth with piping and tubing. Flaps seemingly breathe hot air into my direction, some others constantly suck in fresh air. The earth around it seems barren and lacking vegetation, likely due to the constant heat. 
I have occasionally observed these devices to bury or extract themselves from or into the ground, accompanied with a burst of heat or cold. 
## Sphere
A massive metal sphere, half-stuck to the ground. Several engraved lines run across it, lining up on a central opening, like a eye iris. It lies dormant, but i am afraid of waking it, since it hums faintly on touch.
On my journey, i have spotted a-many of these, all in a similar state of disrepair. 
They vary in size, but i have not found one smaller in diameter than my leg is long.
