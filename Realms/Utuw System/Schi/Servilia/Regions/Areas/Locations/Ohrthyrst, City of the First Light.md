Ruins, where once the [[First Light]] was kept lit. 
Now desolate, left neglected by those who once entitled themselves to keep it. 
Somewhere in the highlands, along nothing but rubble and dust. 
Once towering among these plains, the epicentre of life radiated by the First Light. Enshrined by dense vegetation-turned-barren, sprawling stalks now dead. 
Reduced to embers, simmering ash.
An empire of dirt. 
Forgotten and abandoned. Even by those things that come claim the forgotten and forlorn, the vines, the scavengers, the tooth of time.
