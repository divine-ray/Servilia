Sectors is the designation given for the chassis of a [[Numerator]]. As every numerator is able and required to manage their structure, these reflect the numerator's character and collective identity. 
This self-governance, long trials and conflicts have led to them being treated as states of their own. 
In the organisation and hierarchy of [[Amida]], sectors are directly subordinated to the [[Board of Amida]].
Sectors are further subdivided into [[Segments]], which would equate to counties or boroughs. 
The population of a sector ranges wildly dependent on the policies of their respective numerator, spanning from as few as 75000 individuals to several million.
