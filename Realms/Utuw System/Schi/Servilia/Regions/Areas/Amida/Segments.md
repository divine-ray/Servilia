Subdivisions of [[Sector]]s, these units coordinate and govern over lesser decisions and projects that are not of concern to the sector. For example, most construction or chassis-related decisions are planned within segments, and then proposed to the iterator for trial and execution. 

Most smaller businesses (which aren't banned or combatted by [[Board of Amida|The Board]]) operate on segment layer as well. 

A sector (and thus numerator) might be composed of up to 200. This is the highest recorded case of the biggest iterator known before it split up. The primary Numerators hit up to 130 segments, with an average of 76 for every present elegible numerator. 

Segments are further divided into [[Circuits]], which act as smallest subdivision of numerators.
