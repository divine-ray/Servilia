BCI-based interrogation chamber connected to a small-scale wiped [[Numerator]].
Blindingly white and bright, reminiscent of olden day medical facilities on Earth.
The chamber is barren, set aside from the worn BCI terminal and cheap, peeling cladding, which hides reinforced composite concrete. 
An obnoxious duct fan is echoing through the chamber as if it is in its dying throes. 
Some high-frequency noise stemming from the antiquated fluorescent lights pierces my ears.
Dark corroded spots, who appear to be floor grates, tell a tale of bloodshed. 
Closer inspections of the BCI terminal reveal a faded and scratched-out specification panel, on which someone smeared incomprehensible graffiti. 
Two rubberised dispensers are mounted at knee height, one with nondescript "food" pellets and one with chlorinated water. Both are protected against vandalism and reinforced to prevent tear.

Empowers the connected subject to the extreme processing and sensory capacities of a Numerator while being exposed to echoes and remnants of previous subjects. 
Secretly doubles as selection process to judge if some subjects bear favourable traits to be integrated into one of the established Numerators.
