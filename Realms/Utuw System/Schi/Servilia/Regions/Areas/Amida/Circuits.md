Smallest division and constituent part of [[Numerator]]s, these units typically encapsulate little more than a few buildings or closed-off structures. Subordinated to [[Segments]]. 
These typically have a few hundred, barely thousand residents. It is common for these residents to gang and band up into self-governed communes and neighbourhoods. 
However, this also leads into a rampant tribalism, which is why most small-scale conflicts originate and end on circuits. 

Larger production and manufacturing facilities may take up entire circuits, but that is a rare occurrence.
Due to their mandated modular structure, an numerator is capable of rearranging its circuits if a [[Request for Rearrangement (RfR)]] has been passed. 
Transportation and logistics between circuits is typically done using [[The Cold|Cold]] vessels.
