%%SICK Illusions and Club Kink?%%
%%Sinister Oasis of Kinky Delights? dawg whats this, SOKD???%%
%%Sinful Indulgence Club & Kink%%
The club-brothel-community in [[Amida-12]], harbouring a very lax and liberal group of mutually-understanding nymphomaniacs and similar odd folks. 
The Avatar of A-12 is inclined towards SICK and therefore protects the organisation and its properties, albeit without much care. 

This is where we live, turning sin into virtue, committing to the lifestyle. 
Give up your restraints, live your little life to it's fullest. 
There is so much you could do, yet you choose to waste it with unpleasantries. 


One of the more influential organisations within A-12, as it owns a fair segment of housing and *entertainment* spaces alike.
Stained with a **sick**ly sweet reputation among A-12, as their elusive services has gained them prestigious remarks. 

Primarily catering towards kinky fur folk and synth life, inherently gate-keeping towards commonfolk. 
Quite protective and subjectively safe compared to other, similar institutions around A-12.
Oftentimes recruits and hires volunteers for some stability in their life in some action of "welfare", granting them housing from the club-owned flats. 

The dance floor, poles and other set-pieces of performing are regularly scheduled to be a canvas of free expression towards visitors and residents alike. 

This place must seem utmost bizarre and nigh-disgusting to outsiders, as local residents and visitors all exchange on lusty and flirty ways. 

Ran by [[Evelyn]] and few others in a style akin to direct democracy. 
Its different departments (bar, dance floor, dungeon, etc.) are treated like states as in-joke.
