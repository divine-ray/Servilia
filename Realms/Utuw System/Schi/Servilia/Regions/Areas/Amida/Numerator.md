Big if not titanic organic and sentient supercomputers in search for a solution to the [[Curse of the Undead]]. Their entire structure houses a [[Sector]] each, as they govern infrastructure. 
Numerators were able to interact with the control of the [[SC-AM]] project and tap the power output for [[Amida]].
Most of the heat produced is absorbed by purposed [[The Cold]] tissue to recuperate energy and not to suffer a fate of a rainy world.

Modified Cold tissue has been tamed to form transport pathways throughout each Numerator structure; Strands and bundles of neurons, veins and other capillary paths facilitate most matter and information (including civilian) transport within each numerator.
General population is aware of the rough task of the numerators but they don't really care other than for housing and [[Amidan Infrastructure & Utilities U.P.C.|utilities]]. 

As each Numerator is sentient, they shifted and changed their structure to reflect and express themselves, which contributed to the erratic and organic looks of Amida as whole. 

Most numerators have been granted governing permissions, and act as independent entity on behalf of themselves and their populace. 
This has empowered nearly all nums in this category to enact immigration policies which applied a filter to their population median. 

Each numerator possesses an avatar, which is usually entrapped within its [[chamber]]. Avatars outside their chamber are rarely seen, and oftentimes carry a prophetical gossip as it means that this numerator was not able to ‘remotely’ solve the problem at hand. 

The collective of Numerators is possibly scheming a coup or other way to rid of the corporate board.
## Sectors, as divided by Numerator:
- [[Amida-5]] is the government/corporate HQ and management
	Control
- [[Amida-8]]  is the synth^[read:android, pseudoneo] ghetto
	Regrets for Newborn
- [[Amida-9]] is the Space elevator and [[Argrosy|Mass transit hub.]]
	Icarus
- [[Amida-11]] is the accumulation sector of furries. 
	Alteration
- [[Amida-12]] is centred around brothels, clubs and other institutions of pleasure. 
	Desire 
- [[Amida-13]] houses cults and the remnants of Mekhanites and Nolka. name
