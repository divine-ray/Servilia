The first avenue in [[Duley and Port]] which uses electric lighting (of arc discharge lamps) over petrol or coal derived gas. 
Considered a national milestone, true to its nature. 
Lined with lawn and trees, as it has been changed into pedestrian and bicycle use only in the conversion to electricity. 
Has an unofficial but condoned access point to the [[Duley Tunnel Rail]].
