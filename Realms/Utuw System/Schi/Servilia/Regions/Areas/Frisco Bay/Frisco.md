#Settlements #Faction 
The only other noteworthy human capital besides Thylyist, namesake to the [Bay](Frisco%20Bay) and [[Frisco Bay Confederation|Confederation]].
Originally founded by alive[^1] outcasts from Thylyist, they freed themselves from the nonsense of conservatism and doctrine, making them the de-facto leader in economic and scientific strength. 
Central railway node, since the Friscoan built most if not all of the [[Servilian Railroad and Train Network]].

Economically strong due to being central to trade, travel and business. Rather capable of competing with Thylyist, thus repeated victim to the [[Dogs of War]] in attempts of sabotage. 
Rumours have it that the researchers over in Duley and -Port are working on novel and experimental military equipment to end Thylyist...

Their [[Duley and Port|development]] is seemingly stuck on the age of late industrial revolution to early accesses to electricity, yet no major fossil fuel usage is employed (oil). Coal and steam remains a widespread power source for industry and locomotion. 
Sailing ships still reign supreme in their naval trades over at [[Brisburne]] Harbour. 

They possess a unfinished [[Argrosy]] station, and are only half-aware of it. Some spelunkers and excavation teams have repeatedly ran into it, but left it untouched, unknowing what it is.
