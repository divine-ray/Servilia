The only other noteworthy human capital besides Thylyist, namesake to the [Bay](Frisco%20Bay) and [[Frisco Bay Confederation|Confederation]].
Originally founded by alive[^1] outcasts from Thylyist, they freed themselves from the nonsense of conservatism and doctrine, making them the de-facto leader in economic and scientific strength. 
Central railway node, since the Friscoan built most if not all of the [[Railroad and Trains of Servilia Assoc.]].

Economically strong due to being central to trade, travel and business. Rather capable of competing with Thylyist, thus repeated victim to the [[Dogs of War]] in attempts of sabotage. 
Rumours have it that the researchers over in Duley and -Port are working on novel and experimental military equipment to end Thylyist...

Their [[Duley and Port|development]] is seemingly stuck on the age of late industrial revolution to early accesses to electricity, yet no major fossil fuel usage is employed (oil). Coal and steam remains a widespread power source for industry and locomotion. 
Sailing ships still reign supreme in their naval trades over at [[Brisburne]] Harbour. 

They possess a unfinished [[Argrosy]] station, and are only half-aware of it. Some spelunkers and excavation teams have repeatedly ran into it, but left it untouched, unknowing what it is. 

### Notable Locations
 The Dragon Pottery: The workshop of a female-aligned dwarv potter named Gela, built within a large dragon kiln. Gela spends several months filling the shop with thrown pots, then bricks in the door and spends several days firing it. The opening of the fired kiln is a local festival.
