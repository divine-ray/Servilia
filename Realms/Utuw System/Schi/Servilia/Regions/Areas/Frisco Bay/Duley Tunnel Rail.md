Over the years, citizens of Duley have dug out tunnels and other subterranean routes for connecting their cellars with another. This effort has become a local practice and gained a certain reputation ^[which?] 
The biggest tunnels here have a whopping four lanes, two each, stacked upon each other. Ventilation usually poses a hassle though, but early experiments with electricity have shown to be promising. 
Another ongoing experiment is attempting to fit the established and well-performing rail network into these tunnels. 
Recent developments have advanced to a breakthrough, leading to the first Duley tunnel train[^1].
This, of course, has caught the interest of the local administration and the [[Railroad and Trains of Servilia Assoc.]], both of which are now clashing over the rights and concepts of this originally civilian project.
