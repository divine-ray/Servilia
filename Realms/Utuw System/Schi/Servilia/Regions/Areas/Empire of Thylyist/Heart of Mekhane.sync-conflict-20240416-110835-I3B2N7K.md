A large sphere of rotating gears and ticking escapements, crafted from brass and inscribed with glowing runes. *No-one seems to know who created it, nor when, nor its purpose.* 

No tangible power source of this object is visible, and any kind of studies are met with highest force from the [[Followers of Mekhane]] as solely viewing it is considered heresy.

High Constructors believe that this piece is the heart of their torn apart god, the Blessed Machine [[Mekhane]].
It slowly rotates around itself, suspended by axles, crankshafts and other mechanical connections. 

It is hidden deep within the [innards](Citadel%20of%20the%20Gear.md) of Thylyist and amongst the most-guarded locations of the entire empire.

Perceiving it is only granted to the highest [[Followers of Mekhane|Mekanites]] who wish to be blessed with divine inspiration.
