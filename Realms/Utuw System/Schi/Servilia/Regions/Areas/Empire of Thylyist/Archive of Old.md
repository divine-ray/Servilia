The Library sainted to all [[Shnūt]]s of Time, and all deities of Knowledge. 
In this vast subterranean facility, all knowledge not stored [elsewhere](Elemental%20Libraries), everyone is welcomed to enter their own story into the central Lectern, from which your story is archived.

The Lectern is the central piece to anyone who does only want to place a entry or retrieve a single page fro/to the Archive. It is made from finest basalt, and engraved with a runic interface, which allows any user to request a blank page, and have a finished page sorted away.
Air spirits are volunteering in directing gusts of wind around for delivering and retrieving books and pages from the towering alder wood shelves.
