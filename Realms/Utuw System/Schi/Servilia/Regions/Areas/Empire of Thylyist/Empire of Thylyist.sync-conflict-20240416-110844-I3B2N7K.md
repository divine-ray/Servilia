Capital of the human population; highly advanced in mechanics and metalworking. However, they are strictly conservative, if not regressive, about more advanced technology due to their [[Followers of Mekhane|religious dogmata]]. 
The [[Archive of Old|Archive]] within the lowest Levels feature the staggering history of Thylyist: they [[Fall of the Lavish|eradicated]] [[The Lavish Empire]] after abusing them to forcibly relocate the god-gone [[N√∏lkƒÅ]]. -> [[The Second Era]]
Amida's sector structure is derived from the fact that Thylyist already existed as megacity with several layers.
The Council actually feeds the residents a whole different story, "they're all evil etc etc" and "magic is bad"

## Thylyist Lore
In [[The First Era]], Thylyist flourished in cooperation with the Lavish and Ancients, who all coexisted peacefully.
The human society within the lesser confines of the Thylyian borders flourished and technology was easily compatible and intertwined with magic. 
During the first era, the arcane conductivity of beryllium bronze was discovered, which led to its wide-employed use, which persists to the current date. 
	The pre-pre-predecessors of their culture and technology were actually weaving magic into their mechanisms and such, and after The Ancient Happening (TAHüòõ) the then-council banished and stigmatised any arcane doing, but the usage of beryllium bronze as main alloy remained.
	‚¨ÜÔ∏èThis makes all machinery react really interesting with magic
	Oi, what if the br-bronze attracts spirits and they try to ward them off?
	The Ancient Happening occurred in around 1950-1970's of their time
	Brotherhood Backstab is the entry into the Deep Archives of their doing of nuking the Lavish (Dated 1971)
	The Thylyian council has fallen unknowing of their doings in the past, and thus forgot about the Fountainhead.
