cold and dark, a big cave but one that always threatens to crush u at any moment.
a distant rumbling, crashing echoes through the cracks and cavities, causing a ear-shattering boom. 
you wonder if these caves can act like avalanches; chained collapses.
full of remembrance, memories
but not the pleasant ones - only those of sorrow, sadness and regret. 
the few specks of light across this vast space are golden glowing tears, cried by someone before you. 
they are no more, but their sadness lingers.
