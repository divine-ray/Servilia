A group of islands in the eastern sea of primarily volcanic (basaltic) origin, in a constant swing between ceasefire and dozens of skirmishes with the [[League of Islands]].
they are not recognised in any way or form to be worth of the title of Nation or anything. 

The main demographic group of people living here are pirates, mercenaries and otherwise scummy, typically considered criminal, folk. However, the mercenaries here live up to the ranks of the [[Empire of Winds]] in ruthlessness and brute force. They will do anything for the right price, and nobody ever turned down a deal. 
they are terrorising a lot of the trading folk, as their motto is "leave no evidence", typically removing anyone and anything from captured ships that isn't of direct value to them. 
news agencies in [[Frisco]] frame them to be responsible for [[Automatia|the Automatia incident]], although their [[tasker remains unknown]]. 
Some parts of these islands are the floating [[Corse]]s and their cleaned and stripped skeletons. 

One or two of the about five known skeletons has been entirely disassembled to serve as structural components, primarily for joining the various islands. 
The godskin is still of extreme value, as it's toughness when worked to resemble leather is mythical, both as sail and waterproofing of ship bodies.
