a group of islands in the eastern sea of primarily volcanic (basaltic) origin, in a constant swing between ceasefire and dozens of skirmishes with [[League of Islands]].
they are not recognised in any way or form to be worth of the title of Nation or anything. 

exclusively inhabited by pirates and other scummy folk. they're very infamous for being ruthless at their work, as dirty as may be, and will do anything, if the price is right. 
they are terrorising a lot of the trading folk, as their motto is "leave no evidence", typically removing anyone and anything from captured ships that isn't of direct value to them. 
news agencies in [[Frisco]] frame them to be responsible for [[Automatia|the Automatia incident]], although their [[tasker remains unknown]]. 
some parts are the floating [[Corse]]s and their gutted and skinned skeletons
One or two of the about five known skeletons has been entirely disassembled to serve as structural components, primarily for joining the various islands. 
The godskin is still of extreme value, as it's toughness when worked to resemble leather is mythical, both as sail and waterproofing of ship bodies.
