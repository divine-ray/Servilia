#Void #Locations #Ruin 

This is the interdimensional drilling rig that leads to [[Twilit]] and eventually, the void.
The borehole is [[The Abyss|physically accessible]]. 
Once built as siphon to channel more energies from the Twilit into the material realm, designed to power all [[Arcane Engineering]] throughout the continent. It was later redone and enhanced to allow massive terraforming projects, which culminated in the [[Raising]] of the [[Hollow Mountains]]. 

And now that the [[The Lavish Empire]] aren't here to maintain the catalyst of the Fountainhead, the whole [[Between]] creatures (and -energies) come crawling through the wastes, corrupting the landscape and it's residents. 


> #Quest: retrieve the Catalyst from ??? And repair the Fountainhead
> #Quest : Destroy and seal the Fountainhead

The Wastes around the FH have become [[Chunk of Gliss|Gliss]], a substance with close to zero physical properties, thus, no colour or friction
