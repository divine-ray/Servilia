The Pit into [[Realms/Planes/Dark Domain/The Void|nothingness]], a bottomless well-pit, through which only death and disease is conveyed. 
One daring might take the plunge, lest never return, never the same.
It changes people. It changed the stretches of [[Chunk of Gliss|salt flats]] around it. 
Whoever dares to step beyond the edge is bound to perish.
[[Voidtouched Boots|Or are they?]]

Entryway to the spaces beyond the material world; considered the mound of hell by many. 
Twisted into gruesome shapes from the writhing agony and pain-made-matter of the [[Twilit]]. 
Dark things come this way, seeking out to destroy and carve out those susceptible.
