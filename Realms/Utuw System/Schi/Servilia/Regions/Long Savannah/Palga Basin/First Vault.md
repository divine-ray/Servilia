#Lavish  
 **Location**: [[Palga Basin]]. 

Approx. 5 km northeast of the [[Fountainhead]].

Some rooms are outfitted with Cryostasis capsules, most of which are opaque from rot or shattered. 
Perhaps the last [[Lavish]] remain in here, slowly succumbing to system failure. 

**Threat:** Lethal.

(**C**reatures-**T**raps-**E**nvironment)

- Low level creatures, a few lost Hollow.
- Malevolent spirits and ghosts. 
-  Automated security systems, turrets, weak and rusty.
- Extreme environment level, but the vault provides shielding.
    -   High ionising radiation, bubbling chaos, lurks of void.

 

**Possible Loot:**

(Equipment-Valuables-Currency)
-   Up to 60 HazMat Suits, full sets, slightly deteriorated. 
    -   Gas Masks
    -   Geiger counters
-   Silicon technology pieces and scraps
	- Especially valuable for Sepulchre-Friscoan researchers.
-   Lavish Currency. Worthless to Thylyist, modest value to Frisco.
