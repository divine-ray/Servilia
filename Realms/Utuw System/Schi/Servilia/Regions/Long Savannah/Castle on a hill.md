#Children-of-the-Flame #Ruin
Running up [[A Hill]], there it has a lonely castle, set to rot and salvage.
It's roofing, originally copper, has been completely torn out, and some sections have been demolished.
Former Elvin stronghold, destroyed in the genocidal [[Fall of the Lavish|sweep of Thylyist against the Lavish]].
After the devastation of it and the surrounding areas, scavengers and pillagers tore out anything they could peddle away, leaving the stone brick walls towering like husks. 

[[Leyline]] node due to the souls of unrighteous deceased inhabiting it, which partially feeds the Children.

Headquarters to the [[Children of The Flame]]. Epicentre of the [[Scorched Acres]], hard shell to the [[Crimson Heart]], protecting it and the children from any outsiders. 

Otherwise Home to a few hollowed elvs/[[Varu√∫]], who get supervised by benevolent gnomes/gremlins.
