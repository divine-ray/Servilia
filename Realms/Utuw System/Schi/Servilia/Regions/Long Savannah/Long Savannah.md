#Regions 
Vast and extending plains, found to the northeast of the hollow mountains.

Former home to the [[Palga Basin|Lavish]], now known as [[Lavish Wastes|the Wasteland]].

Dry and arid, the opposite of the dense forest that covers the upper-left of Servilia.
Old records speak of a flourishing rainforest, but only shrubs remain.
The plantlife here is stubby, as if large, towering trees and bushes shrivelled up into miniatures.

Seemingly devoid of higher life, but few scientific expeditions have been made here yet.
No signs of intelligent life have been found here, either, other than the remains of the Lavish.

Eventually transitions into the [[Scorched Acres]], home to the Children of the Flame.
