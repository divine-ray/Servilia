As if a corpse was poorly buried, with its partly rotten partly torn off limbs and skin shown in unsightly ways and pose. 
Stagnant, yet suspended and dormant it lies there. 
Partially aware, partially deceased. 
Formerly a colossus who'd flatten entire cities at a mere tap; the zenith of Mekhane's Design Abused. 
Becrept, befallen with it's archenemy, suffering a same fate, reduced into vermin: the [[Red Plague]].

> Amidst the rugged landscape, a solemn monument to a bygone era stands as the remnants of a defunct war machine once deployed by the Mekhanites in their relentless conflict against the Nolka. The skeletal husk of this colossal mechanical behemoth lies silent, a testament to the ferocity and ingenuity of the warfare that once engulfed the region.

> **Titanic Frame:**
The war machine's skeletal frame, crafted from reinforced steel and arcane alloys, juts out from the earth like the fossilized remains of a mechanical giant. Its sheer size commands attention, with limbs that sprawl across the battlefield, now partially buried beneath the soil. Massive joints and hinges, once driven by potent mechanisms, now creak with the weight of time.
>
> **Intricate Gearwork:**
The exposed portions of the war machine reveal a labyrinthine network of intricate gearwork and pistons, a testament to the precision engineering employed by the Mekhanites. Each gear, now rusted and weathered, once contributed to the rhythmic symphony of war—a mechanical ballet of destruction orchestrated against the Nolka threat.
>
>**Magical Glyphs and Runes:**
Arcane glyphs and runes, remnants of Mekhanite enchantments, still cling to the war machine's surface. Faint traces of mystical energy linger within the markings, a testament to the potent spells that once animated this colossus in the heat of battle. The glyphs, now faded, tell stories of power and protection woven into the very fabric of the war machine.

>**Weaponry Frozen in Time:**
The weaponry, though now dormant, showcases the destructive potential the war machine once wielded against the Nolka forces. Cannons and energy emitters, once capable of unleashing devastation across the battlefield, now sit in eerie silence, their barrels pointed towards a horizon that no longer echoes with the sounds of war.
>
> **Battle Scars:**
The war machine bears the scars of countless battles—a testament to the struggles faced against the relentless Nolka onslaught. Pockmarked armor, scorched surfaces, and twisted metal fragments all tell a tale of the ferocity and tenacity of the conflict that unfolded on these grounds.
>
>**Echoes of the Past:**
Silent echoes of the war still linger around the war machine. The very soil beneath it, infused with residual energies, seems to resonate with the memories of the conflict. It stands as a silent sentinel, a sentinel that witnessed the ebb and flow of war, now frozen in a state of mechanical repose.

>Nature's Reclamation:**
Over the years, nature has begun to reclaim the war machine. Vines and mosses weave through the metal limbs, and small saplings emerge from the joints. The once mighty symbol of Mekhanite warfare is now being slowly embraced by the inexorable march of time and the forces of rejuvenating nature.

>As the sun sets over this mechanical relic, it casts long shadows across the battlefield—a poignant reminder of a war that has long ended but has left an indelible mark on the land and the remains of the once mighty war machine.
