Stretches of desert, shaped by the [[Crimson Heart]]. 
Once grassland like its parent, the [[Long Savannah]], for it has been dried and burnt by the flames. 
Little plants remain, those surviving bent from and to the everlasting cinders omnipresent throughout the unkind sandy stretches. 

Some sand has been baked and fused into alien glass formations, pillars and spires.
Catching the sunlight, they paint a spectacle unbeknown to the strangerâ€™s view, but also blinding an unwary eye. 

Sparse pools of molten minerals turned into most bizarre volcanic debris, commonly brimming with heat from the seething insides.
