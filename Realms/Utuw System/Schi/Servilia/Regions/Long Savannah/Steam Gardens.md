> a unique and equally extreme ecosystem defined by it's intense geysir activity and displaced minerals

The steam gardens describe the various patches throughout the [[Long Savannah]] where some channels of the heated groundwater burst to the surface, delivering steam fountains and plenty of minerals, which supports extremophile life otherwise not seen anywhere. 
Complex life (plants and animals) are almost entirely absent here, but very resilient algae have been seen to bunch up in the hot spring pools. 
Those microorganisms here are responsible for the colourful pools in conjunction with the minerals delivered from the groundwater streams.
Some of the geysir spouts have been corroded severely from these bacteria, as they love the calcite and heat.
