*Meaning of the name: spirit-self city.*
A flourishing and thriving city, dedicated towards research and trade. Originally conceived for such, it became a bustling urban centre of all species working together, which eventually gave way to the [[ti-mud'ĝál Ĝiš-hur|ti-mud'ĝál Ĝiš-hur (Create Life Plan)]].


This city was the one to be gifted the first [[Argrosy]] station, which remains functional. 
Given the diverse cultural mix present, it is considered necessary to go vertical, both into the ground and into the skies, to accommodate all residents.
Relics of their ages can only be called gizmos, however, some of which, remain [[OA-WS BST Model 7ⁿ|lethal and feared]]. 

The [[Varuú]], said humanoid hybrids, are infusing their architecture with twilight, which is a resounding success, as it drastically eases construction work. Earthen spirits and similar aberrations are usually invited, and happily reside in their buildings, as their cheerful character gives each building a own flair and style. The utility value of home-bound spirits is not to be underestimated, as they enable easy reshaping of floors and furniture alike. 

### [[Liches|Lichen]] Reliquary
Before [Dying ceased](How%20Dying%20ceased.md), turning oneself lichen was a rare, but present procedure to gain longevity. This required safekeeping of the vessels, and therefore, the foundation for the deepest layers of [[Sepulchre]] have been laid: to vault off and preserve Lich Vessels.
