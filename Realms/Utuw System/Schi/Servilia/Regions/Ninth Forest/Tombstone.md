> This page covers the [[The Second Era|present]] state of [[Làma'el-iri]], the initial settlement/city-state of the [[Vaaruú]]. 


A overgrown city, situated in the [[Ninth Forest]], [[Fall|laid to waste]] and rot long ago. Perhaps another victim of vessel raids?

This place has been dubbed Tombstone by explorers and scavengers, as its perfect disassembly draws parallels to the masonry on a tombstone. 

Inspection reveals that most buildings seem to have disassembled themselves, in orderly Disarray 
-   Bricks missing
-   Things lacking in places where they should be

Erratic flashes of colour and smoke seem to fleet your view, trying to yell something at you but without you hearing, as you turn your head, they leave again. They want, need to tell you something. 
*With good perception:* The entire area is loudly screaming "LEAVE AND DON'T RETURN"

The roads of this place vaguely shimmer in golden tones.
You easily notice the odd layouts of where buildings must've stood or roads have passed, there seems to be no curvature at all, as if it were all perfectly rectangular. 
It is hard to imagine how it must've shone in its original, pristine state.
Prime architecture, through highest design, reaching for both the ground yet the skies; extending to heaven and hell at once.
Ruined columns stand where bridges used to be, crossing sudden gaps and chasms, which filled have filled with rubble and dirt. 

Deep below, buried beneath all the ruins and debris rests - or rather, unrests - [[Sepulchre]]. 

Inhabited by [[Faceless]].
