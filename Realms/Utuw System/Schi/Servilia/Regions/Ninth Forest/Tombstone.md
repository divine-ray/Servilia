> [!NOTE]
> This page covers the [[The Second Era|present]] state of [[Làma'el-iri]], the capital/city-state of the [[Varuú]]. 

A overgrown city, situated in the [[Ninth Forest]], [[Fall|laid to waste]] and rot long ago. Perhaps another victim of vessel raids?

This place has been dubbed Tombstone by explorers and scavengers, as its perfect disassembly draws parallels to the masonry on a tombstone. 

Inspection reveals that most buildings seem to have disassembled themselves, in orderly Disarray 
-   Bricks missing
-   Things lacking in places where they should be

*With good perception:* The entire area is loudly screaming "LEAVE AND DON'T RETURN"

The roads of this place vaguely shimmer in golden tones.
You easily notice the odd layouts of where buildings must've stood or roads have passed, there seems to be no curvature at all, as if it were all perfectly rectangular. 
It is hard to imagine how it must've shone in it's original, pristine state. 

Inhabited by [[Faceless]]
