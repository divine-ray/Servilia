Cave System

\# Imagine a sprawling deep underground network of small, room sized cavities. Some of them are barren, raw rock and devoid of all life, whereas other as are filled with moss, luminescent fungi, and other exotic specialist life forms that exist underground, Occasionally, these cavities even bear a range of valuable fancy minerals and rocks.

It's certain that these caves have formerly been inhabited by at least one intelligent species, as we found rotten wood struts, leftovers of fibre and metal scraps.

 

Most of these fibres and rotten cotton have been found in a medium sized "room", which bears naturally glowing crystals and something resembling a fireplace. The opening that we suspect of being a former fireplace doesn't show signs of typical uses, though, like char, ashes or cracks in the rock, yet the spot is vibrant with reminiscence and memories.

Roughly based on the fibres, we assume that those products were piled up in the middle for unknown reason. We are assuming for storage purposes, but the fireplace and water flows are counterproductive for a long shelf life. Peculiar.

The cavity where we found the metal remains is surely of the bigger type. Scraps we found once were bars, struts and hooks, some embedded into the walls, we suspect a use of anchoring. There also are some rusted cages here, which led us to the assumption that this was used as prison or dungeon, but again, the echoes deny this, since they show us a past of joy and happiness.

We were astonished by the last cavity which we found, simply because it is so large and vivid. It has a (for underground scale) gigantic lake, bursting of eccentric life and almost a balcony-like formation over the lake. The entire place is sufficiently lit wi by glowing vegetation and minerals. On top of the balcony, wooden remains of unknown origin were in three different, vaguely bed like shapes.

 

Somewhere in the deepest end... We found a dark, rough surface, engraved with strange symbols.
