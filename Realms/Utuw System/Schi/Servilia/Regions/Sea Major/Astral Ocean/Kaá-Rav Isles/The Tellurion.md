The machine for predicting, and possibly altering, orbits. 
It remains unfinished, or never was finished to begin with.

Central to [[City of Stargard|Stargard]], but left tampered and dysfunctional. Its many gears whine and wail on every occasion, subject to seemingly eternal deadlock. None of the local residents have been able to understand the inner workings of this machination nor it's driving force, despite several associations and societies forming solely to unveil the mystique at play. 
Once built by the finest Thylyian Mechanists as gift of peace, it has since been displaced to the isle of [[Ka√°-Rav]], damaged in [[the uprooting]]. 

As spacious as whole plaza, it remains the centrepiece to the [[City of Stargard]], with its many hidden alleyways and paths branching off The Tellurion.   
Empty receptacles, like eye sockets, slot the places where each planet and moon would be.
