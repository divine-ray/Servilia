#Area 
A former rift in tectonic plates caused this jagged chain of volcanoes to tower over the vast ocean. 

Dubbed "left ribs of the world" due to it's regularly spaced peaks, which seem to arch slightly.  
Lesser volcanoes turned into [[Forgotten Atoll|Atolls]] and other smaller islands, who are mostly barren and harsh towards settlers. 
Their volcanic origin and marine erosion created several larger cavities, which now shelter renegades, pirates and similar shady folks.


The central, biggest island spans several square kilometres, which shelters [[City of Stargard|Stargard]] and its Lunatics, and [[Kva'al]].
