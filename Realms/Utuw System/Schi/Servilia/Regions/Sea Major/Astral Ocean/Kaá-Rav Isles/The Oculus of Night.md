 Close to the centre of [[City of Stargard|Stargard]], this dome resides with a circular opening at its centre, supported by a ring of caryatid columns.  
The sky seen through the oculus is perpetually dark, marked by strange, foreign constellations of stars. Through intricate mechanisms, the entire dome can shift and turn, changing its viewport towards other sections of the sky. During day, the "eyelids", two hemispheres, close over the dome through an unseen force.  
The foundation of this dome is made from marble blackened by soot, embossed with plenty of [[Bar of Ithildine|Ithildine]]. This embossment seems to shape some pattern towards the aperture of the dome, but they break off before touching the eyelids or 'eyeball' itself.
