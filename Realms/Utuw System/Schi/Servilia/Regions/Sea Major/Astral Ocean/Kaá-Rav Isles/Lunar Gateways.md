Three arches, forming a triangle. 
One from dark basalt, hot to the touch.
One from blueish ice, frozen forever.
One from white rock, pock-scarred. 

Speculations believe that these arches are gateways made from and leading to each moon, made from their rock and mass gifted to mankind by a deity beyond. 
Stepping into the space of the triangle is forbidden as it is considered sacred. 
Each of these archways seem completely resilient to force, and attempting to moving them has proven futile. 
Each gate fills its enclosing space with a firey/watery/dusty mist according to the lunar phases of each respective moon.
