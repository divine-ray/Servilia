#Regions 
The 'edge' of the known and mapped world. Referred to as The Edge of Hope since no-one who ventured further returned ever since, including dragon scouts and airships. 

This Region marks the seam of the Servilian tectonic plate, covering [[Ka√°-Rav]] and the lands of some[[Northern Reaches]]. 

Possibly obscured by fog and extreme weather like dense thunderclouds. It appears that these may not be of a natural cause, potentially [worth investigating](Edge%20Kraken).
