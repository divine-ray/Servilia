The Lavish collaborated with the Council of Thylyist and constructed the [[Fountainhead]] to siphon the Twilit to raise these mountains, primarily to encase the remnants of the [[Nølkā]]. 
Secondarily, the terraforming has been used to raise the corners of the [[Palga Basin]] to provide more space to the thriving [[The Lavish Empire|Lavish Empire]].
The [[Nølkā]] have effectively changed and shifted over time, and now are referred to as [[Ancients]] in their [[Ancient Exile|Exile]].

The residual energies of the [[Raising]] attract [[Night Runner|Night Runners]].  
Shortly after the mountains have arisen, various dense and rich ore deposits have been discovered, for which the [[Dwarves]] have been created: to mine the ore, which is still peddled and sold in modern times. 
However, the recklessness and disregard for their own safety has left the mountains unstable and without further support, leaving entire peaks vulnerable to seismic activities.
