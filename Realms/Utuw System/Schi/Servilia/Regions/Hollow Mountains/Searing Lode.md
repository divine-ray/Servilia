Within the [[Hollow Mountains]], [[Dwarves]] once struck groundwater, boiling and steaming to the touch.
This led to the discovery of the %%Grand Heater Below, pending%%, easily being able to produce steam to drive dwarven forges and machining alike. 
Originally, the superheated water was discovered to connect through the [[Long Savannah]] up until through the [[Scorched Acres]], where the Heart siphoned the heat. 
One most notable surface breach of this hot water running below are the [[Steam Gardens]]. 

In reality, this is a very potent uranium deposit, which, through groundwater intrusion and a series of lucky events, turned into a high-powered natural reactor.
