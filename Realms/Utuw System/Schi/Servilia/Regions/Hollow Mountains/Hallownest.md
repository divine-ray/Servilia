Within the many caverns of the [[Hollow Mountains]] lies Hallownest, largest settlement to the [[Dwarves]] and many other, lesser creatures adapted to low-to-no-light conditions with minimal space.
Tunnels dug, caverns excavated where rock is soft. This led to erratic structures, impossible to navigate to someone incapable of sensing the abundance of pheromone messaging. 

Further off lie the mines, under constant threat of collapsing.
