A displaced polar cap, frozen over in eternal winter under the frigid grasp of [[The Cold]]. Despite this, the general high precipitation and rainfalls remain, covering the stretches in thick snow and ice. Survival here is brutal, as proven by the rather small biodiversity. However, I do not blame anyone and anything dying out prior to the Cold, as it turned from a modest temperate zone to an arctic yearly average of -30°C. 

This region is heavily influenced by a now-dead volcanism and the everlasting freeze originating from [[The Cold]].

Most significant are towering [[Alp Peaks]], which add the unique climatic aspect by blocking off winds from the sea, a distant and deviated arm of the Astral Ocean.

These peaks seem to be haunted by poltergeists and memetic nightmares, but only during night. This may be a influence from the deviated sea. An above average occurrence of sɹǝuunɹ ʇɥƃᴉu 𝒽𝒶𝓋𝑒 𝒷𝑒𝑒𝓃`spotted` h e r e ¿¡

A similarly weird area origins from those peaks, being the [[Eternal Glacier]]. This glacier poses a temporal anomaly, as anything within its area appears frozen to outside observers. Still, being a glacier, it grinds down its way, eventually into the ocean, where the anomalous effects begin to fade and eventually cease.

Nevertheless, a colossal spire of the hardest rock splits some arm or branch of the glacier, which shapes a massive [[Icy Plains]], which isn't subjected to the glacial movement.
