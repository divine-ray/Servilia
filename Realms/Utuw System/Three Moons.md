Three Children burdened upon their Mother, 
[One](Kynoly) to be firey and filled with wrath and hatred, 
[One](Heaugi) to be left alone, forgotten and left to drown in tears,
[One](Opar) to be made without character, defined by nothing and absence. 

In the absence of their Mother, the three children struggle with their abandonment, each filled with sorrow and fear.
All of them are alone, yet none of them seek company through their siblings. 
Forced to helplessly watch upon the abuse, torment and wounding of their Mother's body, yet corpse as Man keeps spreading their Ideals, their Greater Good, tolling [[The Utuw Family]], making them suffer for their loss. 
[Those few](Lunatics) who treat the [driftwood](The%20Utuw%20Family.md) of the [[Eternal Sea]] kindly turn a blind eye upon the misery of their idols. Are they not aware, or do they choose to not know?
