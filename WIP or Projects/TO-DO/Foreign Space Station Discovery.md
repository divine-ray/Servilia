Approx 1500 second era; Duley astronomers researchers discover that one object previously suspected to be a star is, in fact, a space station in geostationary object approx. 130‘000km above Schi‘s surface. 
They could clearly rule out that it was not a rocky object nor a star, and hypothesised to be an artificial object. 
At that time, it was considered utterly insane and unrealistic for anyone to create something capable of leaving the planet (especially since they know that they can’t really leave the continent) and staying in orbit *and* enduring the unknown conditions out there. Which this station or structure clearly did: endure space for aeons. 
However, the scholars of Duley are very aware of the potential of magics and are firsthand involved in the technological advances, so some very eccentric inventors are already dreaming of escaping the continent. 

Later one (Approx. 1530), with improved optics and data processing, it is revealed that the station is the end point of a space elevator, which has been severed eons ago for it to drift out of position. Hypothesis includes severe damage to the station from fragments of the shattered cable.
