#TODO #Structure 
The city core is looking like a cubist painting, perfectly rectangular and squared. further out, it looses this pattern, turning into a lot of rounded and organic shapes, which are more welcoming towards spirits and other magical beings. 
[[Worldship Nemus|World-Trees]], as those from [[Dhât út-Bhadan]], are common around here (as they're the only comfortable housing for dragons). They're neatly trimmed into massive, sculpted bonsai trees, with each branch plateau providing resting space to several adult dragons. 

[[Court of Storms]]: big. a court hall without proper roof, seated with the eleven masked judges and [[The One Who Judges]].
The One is a amalgam of Vessel masks, warped and fused into a big, floating mass? amalgam? thing. The gaps between the masks are filled with a swirly goop, coloured red and deep purple. as of present, it has been ripped apart and its fragments have been repurposed in vessels. 
the one is possibly a central node to tombstone's amarisk and twilight fabric and etc (as in, it conducts amarisk for easier use), and it's destruction/death made a lot of the buildings fail and crumble.
Moreso, it acted as relay to the fountainhead.
