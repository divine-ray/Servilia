There was something about "Villains"/Antagonists who fumbled and bumbled their way onto this situation, and never had an intent to become "EVIL". 
Generally speaking, the concept of an explicit villain who only exists to stop or slow down ”[[the protagonist]]” (apply shiny paint coat as necessary) is old-school and boring. 
Instead, the protagonist should just be a regular person with their own woes and issues. 
As the saying goes, you are your own greatest enemy. The only benefit of setting it in a fictional world lies in possible personifications and extracts of these issues, i.e. having their depression manifest as malicious, looming shadow or the likes.
