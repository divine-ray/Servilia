## Species
- [ ] [[Vaaruú]] 
the experiments of lavish pseudoneo capabilities on humanoids, infused with twilight, building the city known as `[[Lost City of the Ninth Forest|Tombstone]]`, and the \[\[Archive of Old]]. Probably the first group to be shoved into Exile. 
- [x] eurasian shadowmaw, also rebrand to fit (Padia?)
- ### northern glasswing??
- [ ] [[Lavish Rework ⁄ Lore]]
- [ ] [[Dwarves]] overhaul and physiology

- [ ] OA-WS
	- [x] Mortar
	- [ ] sub-machine gun
	- [ ] guided rocket launcher
	- [ ] mini-gun, possibly? seems very op
- [ ] \[\[Tomes]]
	give each tome a comprehensible function and relevance in some way
	they shouldn't feel like generic fetch quest/McGuffin, but rather instil some strong feeling of dread/power/fear etc
- [ ] Materials
	- [ ]  `[[Splinter of Blazes]]`, other fire related items (Gem of Cinders, simmering rock, etc. )
	- [ ] Various metal plates for armour making 
## Oh, the magic
Write down the entire custom spellcasting system, using gloves/books/wands/staves
- Spellcasting system using gauntlets, wands, staves and books, who'se modular
- Amarisk writeup 
I presume that to cast a material spell using a glove, one would have to cover the gauntlet in the material blend (which might turn out rather unpleasant or impossible) or use it as a compressed pellet of sorts, similar to the OA-WS firearms
perhaps some mechanism to dispense material component pellets into the gauntlet?
- [ ] [[Twilit Casting]]
- [ ] [[Tomes of Twilit]]
## Pantheons 
(All the gods, etc)
- The Great Three: Humans / Dragons / Lavish 
	Yalgabaoth, -uh?- and -uhmm- 
	The trinity of civilisations, grand comets, deities, cultures, moons, etc. 
- Celestials -> [[The Utuw Family]]
	- [[Darb ut-Tabānah]], all the other Tabanah
	- [[Schi ut-Pula]], the other Pulastaya
- categorise deities (beyond, celestial, demigods, heroic given power) (heroic given power are people like marilee or bones in the ocean guy who just became a icon through some fabled act)
- The narrative power/energy and shared belief of any group may give birth to any deity at any point in time. -> birth of deities
- [[Universal Pantheon]] 
# Jumbled
## Misc stuff
make the calendar have hunter/~~wanderer~~/renegade gatherings every nth full moon of moon xyz
recurring meteor showers
`[[Court of Storms]]` as part of tombstone's upper levels which are now ruined 
oh yeah i should define how long a short/long rest is for combat balancing purposes
`[[Generator Snippets]]`
Time travel backwards with information from the [[Epos' Manuscripts]]?
this will be VERY unpredictable as I'd have to account for time branch shifting and all that madness -> terminator gambit xdddddd

` ### [[Proper Plot]]` lmao

Riders on the Storm 

- [x] `[[Symbioparasite]]`
##### Constructs
throw golems and other constructs into placces, they're neat
##### Mother,
 the trees (ninth forest subarea) are calling for my names; they whisper that i am wanted back home.
##### Wizards off the Coast
 as group of mages who are extremely selfish and greedy (as to nudge at the makers of D&D)
 SHADOW WIZARD MONEY GANG 
	 WE LOVE CASTING SPELLS
##### bones in the ocean
some guy who almost drowned, but lost his humanity (turned hollow) in the near-death experience
and now fulfils '*some*' role for the seafaring people and undead, akin to marilee
 
##### [[Nølkā]]
The pre-first-era ancestors to the Children of the Flame, which warped flesh using amarisk. 
- [ ] They inspired the Lavish in their biotechnology, but eventually went extinct in the conflict of Mekhane v. Sarikite. Few tribal settlements exist, but those have slipped out of knowledge. 
>Homebrew#Mekhane and the Plane of Mechanus, [[Before the First Era]]
##### Passing away of undead
the terminal express and three moons initiative

Charon has retired since the curse of undying has been set free, further complicating the departure of deceased
The River Styx has dried out, thus other ways of departure from the mortal world are required, such as the terminal express 
however this one's man-made and thus not granted divine perfection and blessings along its travels 
##### The system that explains modular armour and Splints
> Armour may be modified at any time, given the required expertise. 
> Some pieces may be fitted with splints, which enhance the capabilities of this piece. Splints may be of organic (i.e. scales) or of inorganic origin. 

##### Methods of getting around
Mounts, Magic stuff, Vehicles......
`[[Quick Travel methods]]`
Portals/wormholes/twilight rifts
tl;dr loops in spacetime or twilight fabric that allow physical passage to another place 
- [x] `[[Riftstones]]`
#### Mainline D&D 5E crap
Zumindest die meisten D&D-Kampagnen erfordern die folgenden Elemente:
- [ ]  Eine Ursprungsebene für Unholde
- [x]  Eine Ursprungsebene für celestische Wesen
- [x] Eine Ursprungsebene für Elementare
- [ ]  Einen Ort für Gottheiten, der zugleich auch eine (oder mehrere) der vorgenannten Ursprungsebenen sein kann
- [ ] Den Ort, an den sterbliche Geister nach dem Tode ziehen und der zugleich auch eine (oder mehrere) der vorgenannten Ursprungsebenen sein kann
- [ ] Einen Weg, um von einer Ebene zu einer anderen zu gelangen
- [ ] Eine Möglichkeit, mit der Zauber und Monster funktionieren, die die Astralebene und die Ätherebene benutzen
#### Space travel
Spelljammers or general spacefaring ships -> [[The Celestial Compendium of Schi]]
dragons in space lmao
perhaps rediscovery of lavish biotech merged with the arcane and tech resulting in sublight ships
[[Spelljammers]]


The [[Black Parade]] as military for Sepulchre

[[Café at the End of Time]]

[[The Six Seals]] -> comets to moons 
## Random ass thoughts 
(honestly, I'm proud of this work. wowee.) 07.09.23:: what a world we live in, eh? :P
time to quit before we start the dialogues again- 
### Open end principle
conceptually i want the world to be as open as possible, with as little restraint (outside from "i cast wish for my personal fuckquest") as possible 
### Alive world
i'll try my best to make the world feel 'alive', as in, time passes and events happen, such as stores opening and closing, economy ups and downs, crap breaking down, etc. 
and give potential confronting NPCs a little backstory that they could talk about
Rumours that spread and possibly motivate other people to gang up and form adventuring squads, etc. 
Weather events that affect agriculture or cause fires.... 
Time passes between sessions. stuff happens. (i.e. printing is developed, etc)
