One of the few pure synthesised numerators, which started out as humanoid android linked to a wetware supercomputer. Their autonomy and attempted initial blending amongst the humans got them rapidly intrigued in human sexuality. It did not take long for them for their studies to turn into practice, and this escalated until their entire [[Sector]] got dedicated to a fine collection of clubs and unions representing sex workers. 
Shocked and traumatized with the first experiences of anarchy and abuse in this situation, the sector quickly enforced strict working policies and human rights. These are enforced by delegate units directly controlled by the avatar. 
Naturally, this (relatively) high standard of living has attracted the interest of several other factions.
