Part of the reason why the countryside has become so derelict and abandoned is the aftermath of the conflicts with the lavish (Pseudoneos and other monsters running wild), and the destruction/drought of overland trading and travelling routes through [[teleportation]], [[Riftstones]] and the [[Argrosy]]. 
The socioeconomic consequences destroying the countryside is also one of the major reasons why the use of weave and amarisk-based practices are commonly met with hatred, [[witch-hunts]] and violence.
