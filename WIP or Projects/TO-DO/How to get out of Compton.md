There is only one way to get out of Compton with your life. One must follow these instructions if they wish to exit.

1. Move through Compton and go to the back alley of El Pollo Loco.
2. 
3. There will be a dumpster with a small compartment on the side facing the building. Open it.

4. There will be a burlap bag with the required tools for escape.

They should be:
A. A straight razor.
B. A bag of The Colonel's fried chicken.
C. An unreleased Tupac album.
D. A live grenade.
E. A clove of garlic.
F. A double sided bible/Koran.
G. Metallica's "...And Justice For All" album.
H. A fragment of the Spear of Destiny

4. Take the bag and move towards the Gateway Shopping Centre.

- The citizens of Compton will naturally sense fear and the longing for escape, and will attempt to bite/kill you. If you or a companion is scratched or bitten, the victim will only have an hour before they become an official citizen of Compton. If bitten, take the grenade, arm it, and attempt to take as many of them with you.

- The fried chicken and the Tupac album are items of distraction if you must get away from a large mob.

5. Once at the Gateway Center go into the Staples and knock on the managers door.

6. Recite to the door: _Acceptus ut Libertas_.

7. The door will open revealing a large speaker system.

8. Place ...And Justice for All into the system and press play.

9. Blackened will play. This will temporarily deafen the citizens of Compton, rendering them useless and it will unleash Letro: The Dragon of Compton.

10. Using the fragments of the Spear of Destiny and the straight razor, slay Letro.

11. Remove the dragons' head and place the clove of garlic in its' mouth.

12. Dig a hole in the ground approximately 12ft. deep.

13. Place Letros' head into the hole and move 1 foot of dirt upon it.

14. Place the double sided Bible/Koran into the hole and cover it up. This should open the fiery exit gates of Compton.

15. An earthquake will occur, run through the gates and escape to the nearest town.

16. Never return.
