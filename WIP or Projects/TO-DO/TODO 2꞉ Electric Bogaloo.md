#Structure #TODO 
the old one was getting too crammed for my own comfort so here we are

I’m going to handle this more of a random drafting page than anything, for the time being

# Charon
The ferryman Charon, he who transfers the souls of the deceased, was rendered unable to execute his job (somehow).
so I’m assuming it is in relation to god-became nolka in cooperation with a group of varuu that they managed to either incapacitate Charon or his boat or the rivers Styx and Acheron.
(Styx is the river that connects the material plane to the `cosmic foam`, and Acheron springs from the end of Styx into the afterlives.)

> There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast –  
> A sordid god: down from his hairy chin  
> A length of beard descends, uncombed, unclean;  
> His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire;  
> A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire.

## Beyond the Pale Veil
possibly the utuw system is enclosed or wrapped in a Dyson sphere by a unknown actor?
or to contain something considered malicious?

## Dunestriders
clay vessels, covered and possibly filled with mire and tar. origin unknown, yet they wander the dunes of the long savannah and sandy areas. oftentimes found in large herds, like flocks of sheep and cattle, but without their shepherd. 
never inspected up close as their massive apothecaries, held high up by strands of tar, instil dread and fear towards local folks and oftentimes cause them to move or flee.
