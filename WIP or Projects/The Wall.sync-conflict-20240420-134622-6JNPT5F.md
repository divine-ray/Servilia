The Wall, in the middle of nowhere. Made from what we assume to be white marble. Bricks are scattered around the lands, one finding to another through a curious adventurer. 
It's mysterious, we do not know what it is built for. It is speculated that something will happen if it is completed. 
We tried to move or tear it apart, but the bricks resist any force we exerted on it, even gunshots or explosives. 

It grows for sorrow, as trailing tears encrusted on it are enamoured by rocky growths.
