The Wall, in the middle of nowhere. Made from what we assume to be white marble. Bricks are scattered around the lands, one finding to another through a curious adventurer and another. 
It's mysterious, we do not know what it is built for. It is speculated that something will happen if it is completed. 
We tried to move or tear it apart, but the bricks resist any force we exerted on it, even gunshots or explosives. 

It grows for sorrow, as trailing tears encrusted on it are enamoured by rocky growths. 

Bricks seem to weep their own mortar and cement, fusing a newly added brick to the assembly.
We tried to add the few loose bricks we had on top of The Wall, but these refused to weep their mortar, making it impossible to stack it higher than a standing man's chest. 
We tried to use regular mortar and cement, which... seemingly dissolved into puddles of mired water.
