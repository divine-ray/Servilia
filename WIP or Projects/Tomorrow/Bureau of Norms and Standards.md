The Bureau of Norms and Standards is a sibling government agency, working in tandem with the [[Finance and Economic Overwatch Agency|FEOA]] to develop and enforce regulations and standards together.  
The Bureau develops standards and norms and FEOA enforces them.  

It was founded during the end of [[The Second Era|Melonare]] (The Second Era), when resource usage and company-internal standards became a critical concern.  
In fact, companies grew increasingly hostile towards each other in their products and strategies until the freshly-founded FEOA incited the [[Company Clash]].  
After the clash, the BoNS got empowered to develop nation-wide technical norms and such, which were enforced under the threat of dissolution, if a company did not comply.  

Nowadays, the BoNS has achieved several milestones;  
Food containers at markets and stores are universally standardised, and retailers are forbidden from packaging products and goods in single-use containers.  
Technical devices and machines are nationally interoperable and are repairable and provided with instructions to do so.  
Despite many conflicts, the [[Railroad and Trains of Servilia Assoc.]] has been forced into adapting a single gauge.
