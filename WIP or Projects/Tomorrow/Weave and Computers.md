by the time frisco technology approaches [[Tomorrow]], they’re already quite proficient with weave and amarisk manipulation, and might just start to use folded weave to create inflated spacetime pockets within computers or electronics (TRON Grid) for more efficient programming and planning of about everything
no point in keyboard, mouse, HIDs if you can just go *inside* of the computer
this is also the technology that enables avatar [[chamber]]s to be so flexible

id imagine that this tech drastically impacts connectivity and their equivalent of an internet as well
also also instilling a tiny fragment of twilit into computers does certainly sound like it would aid with processing and possibly “AI”/synthetic computer intellect reasoning (SCAR) 
though, cramming twilit shades into PCs does make them prone to instabilities and very erratic behavior on occasion (literal haunted PC)
something something “this pc will explode if it fails a single calculation step”
likely contributes to [[Rouge Matter-Energy]]
