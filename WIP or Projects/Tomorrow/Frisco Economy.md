How do we approach the [[Frisco Economy]] to have the continuous self-improvement and competition for optimisation from capitalism BUT without the part where companies squeeze every single penny out of their employees, dry up all resources and mess up the government and market just to generate more money for the tycoons?

One part of the puzzle to regulate the not-quite-free market is the [[Finance and Economic Overwatch Agency]], which is empowered to pressure and potentially dissolve unruly businesses.

I will gloss over the economics of pre-electrification and electronics Frisco, since I do not want to bother with that and because a Cybersyn analogue is pretty damn cool. 

Each year or fiscal cycle, the highest layer of the government or a specific agency thereof consults with a group of neutral experts to create a portfolio of the upcoming cycle's projected economy, plans and regulations. Before the draft of this portfolio is enacted, a randomly chosen set of workers and managerial people are called upon for criticism.  
At the end of the fiscal cycle, a large share (if not everything) of excess profit and goods are invested towards welfare and overall betterment of living. 

Each cycle, companies and businesses of any scale have to compile a volume of records entailing their transactions, products and services, which is submitted to the FEOA via electronic transfer.  
Any suspect of falsification or untruths in these records immediately warrants an investigation. If this investigation confirms deviations, the difference between the findings and false records is forcibly extracted from that company.

To organize and exploit the resources of a nation upon a gigantic scale, to regiment its farmers and workers into harmonious corps of producers, and to do this only in the name of an uncontrolled appetite for private profit—here surely is the great inherent contradiction whence so much disaster, outrage and misery has flowed.
