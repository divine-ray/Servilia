This page officially cements the Tomorrow timeline of near-future developments of Servilia, serving as gap between the [[Present]] and [[Future]] (aka [[Amida]]).

![[16.07.25~10-31-03]]

Frisco of Tomorrow has developed a fundamental understanding of silicon semiconductor technologies and is starting to implement computer systems. They have studied the [[Searing Lode]] well (curtesy of the [[Searing Lode Research Initiative]]), enough to manufacture and confer nuclear reactors capable of powering city districts.

Computing technologies are being developed alongside [[Arcane Engineering]], which led to [[Weave and Computers]] being commonly available.  

The economy in Frisco has been put to strict supervision by the [[Finance and Economic Overwatch Agency]]. 
By extent, the FEOA and sibling governing body, [[Bureau of Norms and Standards]](BoNS) are enforcing a wide range of standards and regulations, part of which are targetting economic efficiency and interoperability, especially with complex digital systems on the rise.
