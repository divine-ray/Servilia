The nature of the [[weave]], it throwing waves and varying in its causality and nature is bound to shape clumps and accumulate in [[Phenomenon|Phenomenae]] considered anomalous. 



shit like [[Ghost Stations]], gravity wells, discolouration ([[THE WHITE WOODS]]), possibly transforming (small) bodies of water to be direct access-es to the [[Astral Ocean]], temporal dilation, ye goode ole fire/lightning ball, 
actually, echoes are their own kind of anomaly come to think of it
distortions in gravity would cause some peculiar effects, like hovering stuff or water spheres
itd be interesting for these effects to be compounding or additive, and I don’t see why they should not be

one thing that makes nearby machinery hatch and grow up 
	ie they drop their chassis or cladding and gain extra parts and components that benefit/augment their purpose 

[[shadow-prints]] or travellers past:
	I imagine that touching one of the travellers past is like inhaling a man-sized (glue) fume cloud but it's also ram full of that person's memories etc
	buuuut it gives you magic brain cancer which replaces your own memories with theirs until you ultimately get fully replaced by a commuter past
	this 'cloud' is also like a shadow that repeatedly acts out the movements that the original person did
