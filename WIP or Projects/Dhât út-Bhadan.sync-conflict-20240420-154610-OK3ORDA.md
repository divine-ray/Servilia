The Tree of Knowledge. 
Home to [[Leonis]], the Librarian. 
This tree houses several thousand if not tens of thousands of books and other written media. It considered a place of pilgrimage to many mages and alike due to the extensive knowledge on any subject available here. 
The resident tree spirit, [[Dh√¢t]], and Leonis are both formal members in the [[Erudition Coven]].

Alongside the extensive library present here, Leonis also tends to his other hobby: Tea. -
