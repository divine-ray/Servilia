how do we approach the [[Frisco Economy]] to have the continuous self-improvement and competition for optimisation BUT without the part where companies squeeze every single penny out of their employees, dry up all resources and mess up the government and market just to generate more money for the tycoons?

one of the current solutions, well, rather enforcement is the [[FEOA]], but we did not write out the actual policies or summaries

I’m going to gloss over the economics of pre-electricity and electronics frisco here because I don’t wanna bother
also because cybersyn

the government or a specific board thereof (board? amid reference??), along with a bunch of neutral experts, come up with a document or portfolio entailing the economy projection of the upcoming year, and any excess of that is redirected towards welfare, research and development/advancing standard of living 

companies do have to report their business reports to the FEOA through electronic means, and  falsifying information will be punished through FEOA squads, and the difference between local reports (real) and false report (fake) will be forcibly extracted

Even their quarrels, intrigues and misadventures (too often treated as merely diverting or picturesque) are part of the mechanism of our history. Under their hands the renovation of our economic life proceeded relentlessly: large-scale production replaced the scattered, decentralized mode of production; industrial enterprises became more concentrated, more “efficient” technically, and essentially “coöperative,” where they had been purely individualistic and lamentably wasteful. But all this revolutionizing effort is branded with the motive of private gain on the part of the new [captains of industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/Captains_of_industry "Captains of industry"). To organize and exploit the resources of a nation upon a gigantic scale, to regiment its farmers and workers into harmonious corps of producers, and to do this only in the name of an uncontrolled appetite for private profit—here surely is the great inherent contradiction whence so much disaster, outrage and misery has flowed.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/Robber_baron_\(industrialist\)#cite_note-Matthew_Josephson_1934-8)
