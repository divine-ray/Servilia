[[MECH Units]] and [[ACE-V]] units matching a C.1-C.2 autonomy and intellect score cannot be created battle-ready but instead have to be raised and taught in a ‘evil’ kindergarten where they learn to fight, kill and survive.

Their complexity and autonomy is simply too high to be written via [[Standard Neural Interface]] during assembly/geniture. 
These facilities are typically highly secured to avoid destruction from an infantile MECH intellect throwing a fit. 
Lobotomites or near-vegetative organisms are often used as training dummies to accustom the combat units to their purpose. Oftentimes, [[Crawlers]] are used for this.
