*something about mechas.*

MECH stands for Mobile Entity / Combat Hybrid.

For aerial units please refer to [[ACE-V|ACE/V]] units (Aerial Combat Entity/Vehicle).<br>
The majority of MECHs are comprised of both organic components and inorganic structures. Synthetic muscles and organoids have proven to, in some cases, excel over regular electromechanical or hydro-pneumatic systems.<br>
In sophisticated units, organic systems led to the breakthrough of using organoids resembling brains, which enabled MECHs equipped with these to behave almost human.<br>

Those classes directly controlled or assisted by a humanoid are divided between piloted units and operated units. 
Both operators and pilots insist on being distinguished from one another, in addition to not being seen as "common" infantry, which both pilots and operators deem inferior.
Piloted units are used with a [[SUIT Interfaces|SUIT Interface]].
Operated units are notably more complex, with their Intellect rated C.1 or C.2 and requiring [[Gel Tank Plights|Plights]]. <br>
It is strictly necessary to use a [[MODI Suits|MODI]] to translate between human neural activity and the combination of digital processing and synthetic neural structures present in MECHs. 
Direct [[Standard Neural Interface|interfaces]], with translation inbuilt into the plight or mech, are deemed feasible and may be entering initial prototyping in the near future. 
## Intelligence Classifications
In other documents, the classification is abbreviated into C.1-C.4.
The Intellect piloting a mobile combat unit is classified under three categories:
1. Autonomous
	 - Fully independent cognition, capable of reasoning and own actions. Very rare and almost never seen on the frontline. Most Numerator legislation recognises C.1 MECHs and ACE-Vs to be sovereign citizens with rights equal to organics.  
 2. Hybrid
	- A subclass of 1.: Autonomous, these systems are oriented around providing assistance to a humanoid pilot, but can steer their chassises independently, yet with some impediments to reason and logic.
 3. Restricted
	- Limited cognition, able to execute complex tasks independently of a human, but not capable of higher logic like improvising or replicating emotions and morale. This class is favoured by [[ISONS]] and [[Numerator|Numerators]] as they can be directly linked to a numerator. 
4. Blind, Deaf, Dumb (BDD)
	 - Barely considered intelligent, these units extend the pilot and thus cannot act independently.  
## Exemplary Unit Designs
As MECHs have revolutionised combat and warfare as a whole, they replaced any other previous vehicles or weapon platforms. Even though this technology is still barely out of its infancy, several designs have been developed already, listed below: 
- main battle tank [[Warhammer]] on six/eight legs, autonomous entity with rationale intellect
- scout unit using digitigrade bipedal stride, barely armoured but extremely agile, hybrid piloting (C.2)
- Troop Transport and APC in a quadruped frame, steered by an autonomous intellect
- Heavy biped BDD, doubling as second battle unit.
- quadrupedal restricted + pilot recon/stealth unit, lightly armed, designed for agility and stealth
- Hexapod ([[Scarab]])/octopedal insectoid unit with restricted cognition, primarily for handling cargo and logistics. 
	Can raise up its two front limbs to act as manipulators (Like a forklift). 
- Feline-oriented sniper unit using restricted intel, quadrupedal stride. 
- Digitigrade bipedal unit for close-quarter melee combat. AI/Hybrid.
- [[MEER-C.A.T.]] - quadruped surveiliance and recon unit
