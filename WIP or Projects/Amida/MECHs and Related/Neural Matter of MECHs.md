Some C.1-rated entities like [[MECH Units]] source their intellect/conscious from forcibly assimilating a common organic subject, forcibly 'uploading' their consciousness into the cognition systems of the MECH unit. 
The more common practice places a willing humanoid at the centre of a MECH and is then fused with the machine’s systems.
Commonly referred to as [[Marriage]], as it binds both sides together into a somewhat symbiotic, if abusive dynamic.  In contrast, [[Gel Tank Plights|Plights]] are easier to reverse and intended to leave the organic subject functioning and able outside of the MECH. 
The human psyche can’t undergo this process unharmed, which is why freshly wed MECHs require a certain [[Neural Matter of MECHs|honeymoon period]] to allow the synthetic intellect and organic consciousness to come to terms with another. 
Those minds that try to fight and gain the upper hand in this situation are readily shattered and broken; leading to the psyche and its [[Host]] being waste that the machine needs to dispose of. Those cases are rarer, as it leads to the machine having a fresh organic core to overwrite. 

In-vitro or from-nothing neural mass is exceedingly rare but vastly more capable than humanoid cerebral tissue. Units granted individual and unique cognition typically inhabit the highest ranks and levels, much closer to [[Numerator]]s than common battlefield units.
