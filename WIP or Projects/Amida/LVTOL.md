A type of aircraft, typically able of spacefaring.
Recently developed and employed in Amida, these vessels are launched using vertical electromagnetic mass-drivers on the [[Chassis]] of [[Numerator|Numerators]]. 
The verticality of these craft was necessary due to the lack of overhead-free space for aircraft landing/take-off strips like terrean airfields. 
Additionally, the verticality made the space-capable vessels be constructed in a stacked fashion, much like conventional buildings with storeys, as this is able to utilize the thrust force as replacement gravity.
