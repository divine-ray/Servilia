Morphing Organic Device Interface

A colony organism comprised of amoeba, jellyfish polyps and slime mould, encased in a metallicised chitinous shell. 
These entities directly interface with the neural structure of the wearer, injecting polyp lances into the base of the skull and parts of the spine. 
In the inactive state, MODs form a mostly inert structure sitting on the back of their host. 
The active state unfolds the structure into a full-body armour, with the slime mould providing flexibility and sealing the gaps between the plating.
They do not tap into the digestive system nor bloodstream for energy, though, and instead digest bio-fuel pellets (which is basically just fat and sugar cubes enriched with vitamins and enzymes). 

Secondarily, but more important, is the ability to provide translation between organic neural signalling and digital communication. This ability made them standard issue for [[MECH Units|MECH]] [[Gel Tank Plights|plights]].
