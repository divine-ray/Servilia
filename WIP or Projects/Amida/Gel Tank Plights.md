Connecting an operator to a MECH unit is referred to as Plight, as it is intended to be reversed (unlike Marriages, who are permanent). 
This suspends/immerses the operator of [[MECH Units]], enabling them a near-unlimited movement from within the machine.
Plights are exclusively used for %%SIZE #TODO %% or larger MECHs and other applications in need of human control, as smaller systems can not adequately protect the tank and operator. 
The gel suspension renders the [[SUIT Interfaces]] entirely optional, as the gel facilitates the insulation. However, neural translation and shielding is needed and typically carried out by a middling [[MODI Suits|MODI]]. 
Connectors of the tank thus attach to the MODI instead of directly tapping into the neural system of the operator, which arose as necessity after several [[The Balatro|incidents]] caused the permanent loss of personell and equipment. 
A shielded [[Standard Neural Interface]], capable of preventing malicious take-overs, is proposed and planned to enter the development cycle in the near future.
