[[Numerator]], [[Anatomy of a Numerator]]
a tower/spire on the rough centre containing an important organ or component, possibly the communications array.

So-Called spires are the terminal segment of a LVTOL mass driver system, where the attached vehicle is decoupled and released into the atmosphere.

The above-average height of this terminus also prompted the double use as mount for aerial telecommunications arrays and, in rarer cases, optical point-to-point laser communication. 
These antennas and such tend to be in clusters, some of it are visibly different in form and in function due to being reserved to Numerator communication. The rest usually is used by civilians and corpos alike. 
<sub>Like Antennas to heaven...</sub> 

R&D at [[protoGEN Industrial Group]] has developed hypothetical prototypes of spires that are stand-alone without the chassis' support of a numerator. 
However, this technology and implementation is currently infeasible as the space outside of Amida is \[REDACTED]. 
also serves as beacon/lighthouse for high altitude aircraft and possibly spacecraft [[LVTOL]].
LVTOL as tech for using static linear accelerators/mass drivers to launch spacecraft, but only [[Amida-9]] has an adjustable mass driver.
