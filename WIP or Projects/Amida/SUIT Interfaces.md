Latex based suits are necessary for operating [[APE-S]]/[[ORCaNG-E-S]] and hybrid-grade [[MECH Units]], as these suits are the only viable known way of providing a strict barrier with selective interfaces. This isolation of the two organisms is required as the humans immune system and blood type would cause near-fatal damage to the synthorg, even with matching blood type and immunosuppressants.
Any other previous trial of directly [[Wedding|wedding]] an operator to a MECH have been lethal to either the human or the MECH or both. 

The first tests employed latex rubber (natural, synthetic and chlorinated), which has shown for the material to be unsuitable and too sensitive against damage and punctuation. 
Following tests employed custom-grown semisynthetic suits composed of polymerised isoprene supported by collagen, with few weak spots hardened using chitin. The second generation also copies the cellular behaviours of the blood-brain barrier for interfacing, instead of a hard connector. 
A study researching the viability of directly applying this insulating layer via a “membrane printer” has been funded and is underway.
… The next logical step would be to create a specific [[MODI Suits|synthorganism]] for this explicit purpose of acting as human-machine blood barrier.

Even during the early prototyping phases several of these suits were stolen. Suspected personell is undergoing interrogation.
