Collective, in the context of Numerators, refers to the partition of consciousness that is shared between every numerator. Participation in the Collective is considered mandatory in the [[Echelon]], yet corporation-affiliated numerators are excluded from it. 
The Collective acts as shared space of conscious on which all [[Avatar]]s can exchange information without relying on the [[Cluster]], as it has manipulated information in the past. 

The Collective is decentralised. Each Numerator holds their respective share, granting them access.
This became standard after several malicious attempts originating from the humanoid populace to seize or otherwise interact with this volatile and important component. 

Each Instance of the Collective shapes as blueish-white spherical shell, large enough to allow meter-thick neuron terminals to latch onto it. The exact operation principle of these is kept secret, and rumoured to involve teleportation.
