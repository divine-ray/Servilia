Technical dissection of the construction of a [[Numerator]]. 
***
A Numerator is a megastructure, originally designed and constructed as supercomputer to find a solution to the [[Curse of the Undead]] and [[Theophagy|Dead Gods]]. 
Many such supercomputers have been built over the existence of [[Amida]], which they comprise. Each Numerator‚Äôs [[Chassis]] houses millions of citizens and denizens. Numerators are legally treated as state/county, with their [[Avatar]] being representative of their entire population. 
***
Numerators are either human-bone or synthetic. 
Human-borne refers to a Numerator having a [[Host]] - a former human that has been married to the Chassis and systems. This marriage, much like [[Neural Matter of MECHs]], is destructive towards the human, and permanently fuses the body to the machine. 
Synthetic Numerators, whilst rare, have gained consciousness and sapience without marriage with a previously sentient being. Synthetic numerators are somewhat frowned upon due to their uncanny nature and behaviour, despite having adapted to act as human as they can. Unconfirmed rumours and speculations say that synths use or used magic in their genesis. 
***
Each Numerator, synthetic or not, utilises and runs on a sacred programming language, referred to as [[Holy Code]]. Little is known about it, as the related organisation is extremely secretive about it. Hacks and assaults, both digital and physical, have revealed that this language is unlike common programming, as it has to interface with embedded neural networks. 
***
Numerators are using silicon-based computing, neural networks and quantum computing. The neural tissue is synthetic and derived from human and [[The Cold|Cold]] tissue. The latter proved very beneficial in absorbing and recuperating the tremendous waste heat generated throughout the internal organs. 
***
Numerators have organs, as their chassis is designed to transport energy, goods and citizens using vascular systems. 
However, these are only dubbed organs, as their physical appearance is hidden deep within their chassis. In reality, they are combinations of both biomass and common engineering systems. 
***
There is a covert religious group only recalled by the [[üùã|Holy Symbol]] which revolves around the worship of Numerators and their constituent components. 
***
Numerators each hold an instance to the [[Collective]]. It appears, to the human eye, as large spheroid object, with several dense nerve strands passing through it, presumably to other Instances. 
***
Numerators are all connected to the [[Cluster]], a mycorrhizal network joining every numerator together.
