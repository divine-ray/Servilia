A layer of physical networking between all [[Numerator|Numerators]], resembling a tightly woven net of neurons and arteries, resembling the mutualistic relationship between mycelia and root systems, the mycorrhiza. A discernible difference is the reversal of roles here, in which the neurons provide a hard shelling over the arteries. 
Vital to the continued existence of the [[Collective]] and Amida as a whole, as each numerator's neural structure is too unique to be connected directly to another. Interconnectivity was badly required regardless and thus the cluster became the interfacing network standard. 

Noteworthy in the nature and organisation to the cluster is that it acts as carrier network, with each numerator using the cluster as point-to-point connectivity. 
The neuronal structure of the cluster is regarded as sapient, at minimum cognizant, by most iterators, but no measures and attempts to interact with it have been made, as the [[Echelon]] fears connectivity termination. 

Nearly all of the cluster is either buried deep underground or protected by specially-arranged Numerator components. 
Its subterran nature enables the mycelial portions to tap into deep aquifers and some mineral formations, acting as low capacity organic mining. The aquifer access supplements about 40% of all Numerator's water requirements.  
Despite it's physical strength and bulkiness, it has shown to be weak to physical impacts. It is presumed that the hard neuron shelling has developed after repeated assaults.
