A layer of physical networking between all [[Numerator|Numerators]], resembling a tightly woven net of neurons and arteries, resembling the mutualistic relationship between mycelia and root systems, the mycorrhiza. A discernible difference is the reversal of roles here, in which the neurons provide a hard shelling over the arteries.  
Vital to the continued existence of the [[Collective]] and Amida as a whole, as each numerator's neural structure and thought-form is too unique to be connected directly to another. Interconnectivity was badly required regardless and thus the cluster became the interfacing network standard. 

Poorly understood and equally poorly studied, as access to it is difficult and forbidden to any humanoids. Believed to be a descendant, if not refined and still-living instance of [[Moulen]], indicated by a constant presence of [[Crawler|Crawlers]] near the Cluster.  

Noteworthy in the nature and organisation to the cluster is that it acts as carrier network, with each numerator using the cluster as point-to-point connection. 
The neuronal structure of the cluster is regarded as sapient, at minimum cognizant, by most Numerators, but no measures or attempts to interact with it have been made, as the [[Echelon]] fears connectivity termination or worse. 
After several incidents, thought-surgery was deemed necessary and revealed that the cluster modifies the data transferred, seemingly with intent. Prolonged observation has revealed that the cluster is exerting this leverage to its advantage, having carried out several actions that, over long time, prevented damage to it and the numerators. 

Nearly all of the cluster is either buried deep underground or protected by specially-arranged Numerator components. 
Its subterran nature enables the mycelial portions to tap into deep aquifers and some mineral formations, acting as low capacity organic mining. The aquifer access supplements about 40% of all Numerator's water requirements.  
Despite physical strength and bulkiness, it has shown to be weak to physical impacts. It is presumed that the hard neuron shelling has developed after repeated assaults.
