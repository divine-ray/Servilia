Protocol and internal policy under which a [[Numerator]] is permitted to sever and cut all connections to the [[Collective]] and [[Cluster]], isolating itself and every resident. 
Any use of the Protocol will undergo trial at court after it is lifted, with dissolution of the numerator intellect unless it was proven that the use was justified and appropriate. 
Use of this protocol is limited to conflicts of global magnitude and same such crisis. 
Enacting the Protocol requires unanimous agreement of all sectors.
