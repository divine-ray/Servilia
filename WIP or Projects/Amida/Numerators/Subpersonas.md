[[Numerator]] intellects/consciousnessâ€™ are able of willingly fragment themselves to create subpersonas dedicated to handling specialised tasks. 
These subpersonas typically do not get an [[Avatar]] unless their specialisation explicitly demands one. 
The main consciousness remains in full control over the subpersonas, unless a case of catastrophic failure occurred. 
It may be possible for the consciousnesses to develop a shared space akin to plurality as observed in humanoids. 
Split consciousnesses are required to be stabilised through multiple measures.
