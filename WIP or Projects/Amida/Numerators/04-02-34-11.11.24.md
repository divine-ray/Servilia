For rn I just wanted to remark in the matter of the cluster that it might see issues with its ventures underground to find and process materials due to lag spikes, as for what I've been able to gather a good comparison to the barriers between numerators would be the barriers between different OSs and hardware generations.

When a numerator wants to communicate raw data it does so in binary, facilitating the reception but making the density of the data a nightmare. When a Numerator wants to convey coherent data like a photo, it sends it to the cluster, which then has to decompose it into binary and recompose it in a different programming language/data scheme/image format so the second numerator can see it instead of an encoded file.
  
The intellectual development or design of the cluster would come from the necessity of having an interpreter capable of taking the herculean task of seeing a digital but abstract thought, decomposing it to categorical, solid data and recomposing it to the same abstract message but intended for a wholly different framework.

It'd be an universal programming language machine because it wouldn't be a machine at all but a someone that knows the languages and thus can just pass along the _intent and structure_ of a piece of code to another language rather than literally translating it.

In fewer words, the cluster is an interpreter in the most literal sense of the word; it sees something, interprets what it means and tells it to the subject.
