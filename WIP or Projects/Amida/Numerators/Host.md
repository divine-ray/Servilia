The remains of a human after their [[Wedding]] with the systems of a [[Numerator]], seeding the intellect and consciousness to the structure.
Placed in a casket close-by the [[Core Processing Unit]] - every unnecessary cell removed from the body, leaving only the nervous tissue and circulatory system.
Barely utilised for computation, given the tremendous cognitive capacities, but still integral to the function of the Intellect and Consciousness. Some Numerators insisted to have their Host relocated into their [[Avatar]]. 
Due to its high importance to the Numerator, each has been empowered in the [[Sector and Numerator Independence Act]] to treat their Hosts remains in their own matter. 
The host’s body is, to many, an anecdote, souvenir from their mortal, descended life.
