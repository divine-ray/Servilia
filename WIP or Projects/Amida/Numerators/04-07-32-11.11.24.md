Not that I know of but from their architecture I gather that there's a lot of semi-biological mass taking care of lower, underlaying functions like taking care of lateral thinking, water pumping, "breathing" and so on, with neurons that physically float around carrying data packages that are extracted and assembled into permanent data structures (remember the arms assembling weird structures from red tubes?) so it's like a brain if the information were in binary and stored in ram sticks rather than a set of recurrent chemical reactions.

If the numerators have personalities and thus opinions that means they can abstract a concept or fact from limited information instead of going through the nearly limitless logical gates necessary to describe an idea from simple yes-no statements, since even though they are partly biological they'd likely wouldn't have an "innate" perception of reality so things in plain language would need to be coded in there somewhere. So I'd think of the Cluster as a second hand interpreter that does that job of simply ditching the billion-trillion logical statements that form the plain, intuitive message or idea given to communicate it in a way the second numerator just understands.

This is entirely on me but I've always liked the idea that instead of having the information arrive as is, a system that big and powerful in terms of information storage and processing is basically predicting flawlessly the information sent so, once the initial data is formulated or put in transit, the other side of the system already has it on lockdown.

I just know that animals like elephants, whales and thus extinct megafauna already get massively diminishing returns per brain size so even if you have rule of cool synthetic neurons they'd be best called so casually, because of they're firing electric currents to stimulate chemicals that then form a picture or other form of information you're going to end up with either the slowest brain in existence or something so potent in the biochemical reaction department that it might as well be a system of magma tunnels because it'd be melting the underground.
