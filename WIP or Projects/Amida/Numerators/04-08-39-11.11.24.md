Some stuff a bit more technical would be how does the system actually transmit information and how does that affect the numerators, because you'd assume the idea would be something like an intranet with the cluster as servers, but you run into the issue that instead of wireless signaling and data storage devices with disgustingly complex schemes (I fucking hate them so much if I get another class on it I'm going to be in the news) you have nodes of biological or mostly biological material transmitting the data in a way similar to a brain, a mycelium system or a root system, so it's gonna be a massive expenditure of resources and possibly data to get convenient _and_ reliable communication speeds.

Isn't it a major concern that this living-ish system (Cluster) is autonomously seeking sustenance and presumably spreading in the process? Even if, again, they just cannot be arsed in case something goes wrong, something of that size and nature would be vulnerable from threats beyond physical strikes.

I do get the simil between the trees and all, but in this case the tree's best interest is not developed out of the process of natural selection but conscious and thus reactive thinking, so if the tree in this case is asked to pick its poison, it's gonna start trying to find ways to not get poisoned at all. Then again, I don't really know if there's major differences in the character of individuals or states in this case, so maybe the Numerators just cannot be arsed to intervene if they get their communications running.

But yeah going off rainworld knowledge these numerator structures are very, very important either for a cultural or economical reason, considering the massive undertaking that building them would entail, yeah? If the thing keeping them connected and possibly functional at all is acting in any sort of suspicious fashion I'd wager that either the numerators themselves or the Echelon (assuming it falls under their jurisdiction here) would be absolutely trying to find a way to know the details of the situation to subsequently take absolute control over it.
