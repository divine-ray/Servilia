A marriage refers to the state of a human body and mind being interlinked and co-dependent on the machine the flesh is wed to. 
This process is dubbed [[Wedding]] and is not reversible. The human involved in it will loose its body over time, mainly because the majority of its biomass is deemed unnecessary and removed. The interlinking supplies everything that the remains of the [[Host]] require. 
The few remains of the human are called [[Host]], as its cerebral features still remain important to the joined machine or structure.
