caste system in [[Amida]] dividing people based on their implant status;

chipped
pure
refined 

chipped individuals are grunts; slaves to the system, disabling their individuality and emotions over arbitrary time. the most criminal due to futile struggles to remove their chip at any costs. clans, gangs and networks constantly emerge, clash and fall. the chips can be remotely controlled and in dire scenarios enact censorship on the psyche. 
typically employed in laborious or hard work that robots/pseudoneo couldn't replace. 
second to least life expectancy.

pure people are unmodified in any way. their birthright doesn't force them to chip servitude but doesn't allow refinements and augments. considered wacky snobs which glorify their (little) rights and (few) privileges. 
they occupy paperwork jobs that numerators didn't overtake or ursurp. everyone among their ranks is trying to hide (but visible to the public) that they're doing barely anything. 
least life expectancy due to little physical work and being locked in their ivory compartments of sectors. hardly moves.

refined entities are considered superior to all but the board and the numerators. easily able to efford and maintain augments. highest life , approaching several hundred terrean years. will and can cope using memory fissures. directly interacts with avatars; a rare privilege. occupies high echelons and duties such as Board, Corpo and Warfare.
