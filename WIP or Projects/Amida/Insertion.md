The faceplate folded over their skin, its adaptive lattice enveloping their entire profile, having cold metal scales pressed onto their skin as the latex mask was evacuated.In the brief window of absolute enclosure they gasped for air, left vulnerable and only able to trust the process to not suffocate them.

But this was short and respite had arrived, as the insertion introduced the nasal tubes and feeding pipe into their orifices. 

They felt a bizarre sensation which felt like a horde of insects made from needles, travelling through their ear canals as the insertion provided the upper component of the neural interface. 
With a fast series of near-inaudible clicking indicating the uncoupling, the inserter retracted, leaving wispy strands of polymer-coated neurons to connect with the [[ORaNG-E-S]]. 

They already knew which part as next in this sequence, and braced themselves for impact. 
The mounting frame swung them around to position their neck and spine, rather their replacements, for connection. Nothing will ever dull the sensation of having your entire nervous system wiped and rewritten in a split-second - this is how most operators describe becoming connected.
