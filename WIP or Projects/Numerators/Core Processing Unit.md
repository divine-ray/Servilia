Up and below in the cavern, there is a opening.
Below [The Holy Symbol](🝋) of The Code<sup>x</sup> rests the Processing Unit of this Numerator, blessed and perfected. 
Bedded in suspension, mounted into what little air there is through levitation. Striking temperatures which shatter the steel of the olden ones, it is cryogenic, through which bizarre abilities and phenomena are harnessed. 

Shrouded in the veil of darkness, nothing but the status lights remain visible at any time.
There is nothing to be seen, lest for a keen eye may spot the arteries of copper and nerves of fibre spanning throughout the Chamber, fleeting away into the walls, to wherever they will carry their Data.
Not few synaptic terminals have grown through the plating into the Inner Chassis, where the raw electricity of the cables is taken and refined for the symbiotic organism. 

Far from the Core Processing Unit rests the avatar; the poppet to all computation of the local system. For it is the interface to the mere mortal, the limitless intellect given a chassis to enact its will through. 
The chamber of the avatar; defying any common sense, as gravity is absent and present nevertheless: This to allow the Avatar freest control over it‘s physique.
	What may appear as prison to one is a golden cage to the other, as one is not blessed with the ability to transfer anywhere at will, through will.

Close to the Core Unit beats the Heart of the Numerator its unending drum, one after another. Restless it may be, required to work forevermore for the Numerator‘s continued existence and all of their inhabitants. Through the veins course people and goods alike; it is central to all transport within the chassis. 
%%May the lungs stay pure of the tainted particulates forevermore.
