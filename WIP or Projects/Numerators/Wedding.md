The procedure of integrating and assimilating an organism (usually a human) into a suitable structure or machine. Surgery to make the bodily systems accessible is required, involving removal of the skull and ribcage. The majority of tissue deemed unnecessary is removed and discarded, as the flesh will not (be able to) use it anymore. 
This binds both of them together into a codependent state, as one component relies on the function of the other. 
Human remains held alive by support systems are dubbed [[Host|Hosts]], as it shelters the origin of the machineâ€™s conscious. 
The state resulting from this process is called [[Marriage]]. 


In the rare case that the emergent union decides against stripping the flesh, it will eventually be overrun by tumours and other severe defects, prompting removal.
