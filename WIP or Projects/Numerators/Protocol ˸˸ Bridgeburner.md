Protocol and internal policy under which a [[Numerator]] is permitted to sever and cut all connections to the [[Collective]] and [[Cluster]], isolating itself and every resident. 
Any use of the Protocol will undergo trial at court after it is lifted, with warranted execution/dissolution of the Numerator Core unless justified. 
Use of this protocol is limited to conflicts of global magnitude and same such crisis. 
Enacting the Protocol requires unanimous agreement of all sectors.
