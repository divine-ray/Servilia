General combination of squid and octopus aspects,
"sentient molluscs (octopodia/cephalopodia) capable of coordination and manipulation of their environment"
-> [[Lavish]]

- chromatophores (skin cells capable of colour change)
	- for communication, emotional display
- beaks for breaking items and food apart
	possibly reinforced with metal? 
- two jets for locomotion, one stronger, one weaker one
	- the strong one is primarily for locomotion
	- the weaker one can precisely push stuff around
- two primary eyes, one secondary eye on the downside
- eight tentacles, two of which are longer with a widened end (as rudder)
	- suction cups on the six lesser tentacles to grab and manipulate things
