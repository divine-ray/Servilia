bleh 
I want a collection of anomalous or abnormal locations and places!
first of all: 
we have absolutely no idea how the flip the [[Hollow Mountains]] look like from the inside, even outside of the dwarven places
second:
we have all this talk of the town about how the [[The Abyss]] and fountainhead chaos leaks are corrupting, but zero evidence or representation of that outside of [[Lavish Wastes]] 


really the [[The Abyss]] deserves a rewrite given that its still untouched from the [[Celestial Sea and Ocean Theory]]
adding onto that, we have very little work done on the water regions of the continent, like. there’s next to nothing about rivers, lakes or coastal areas, best we got are the [[League of Islands]] and [[Forgotten Atoll]], maybe [[Kaá-Rav]] or [[Lunar Mangroves]] if you’re feeling like it
and thats not enough for my personal taste, standard and measure of detail 
the concept of a coral highland (I.e. a plateau made of coral, otherwise surrounded by watery depth)
come to think of it, what kind of foundation do we have for the continent to sit on?? or any surface-solid structure, since the ocean is bottomless???
because i reallllyyy dont wanna pull out the plot armour or subnautica floaters or some other wack 

[[29.09.25~08-17-53 citadel core]] is prime real estate for incomprehensible machinations 

really tempting to make one area or place full of lava and geothermal shenanigans (it's the trope, I know, but cool)
