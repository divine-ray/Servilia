new idea time!!
somewhere in Frisco, around the time of primitive computing, the government enacted a law that enables the finance and economic overwatch agency/bureau ([[FEOA]]/FEOB or FaEOA- feowa) to use a division of the military to enforce regulations and conduct dissolutions and insolvencies

for a *very* brief period, companies were not banned from hiring or using mercenaries or PMCs, which resulted in the first economic war (or something), but it was won decisively by the government/FEOA. after that, a clause or regulation was empowered and enforced that banned any for-profit organisations to have armed troops in them

man I'm good at setting up intriguing situations :D but never acting on them D:

something like. during the bureaucracy founding of every company, they're given a document detailing the measure enforcement escalation protocol (meep) which describes the steps the FEOA will make if a company doesn't behave like demanded
the people involved in action and enforcement are usually dubbed MEEPers 


though, at some point, corruption and other instabilities eventually disbanded the FEOA, which is one [[contributing factor to the rise of Amida]] [[Amida]]
