as defence mechanism for the SCaM and general assistance with computing, the lavish created a mycelia (mushroom) based pseudoneo species, tangentially related to [[Symbioparasite]]s.
fungi shan't speculate on the affair of gods, yet they did

we know that this fungus produces a hard outer shelling. only this fungus can dissolve or modify this shell easily, which leds into the illusion of moving yet being impenetrable 

its also known that the spores or other air-based particles expelled by fruiting bodies are capable of targeting the nervous system, preferring higher mammals. this behaviour is parallel (inspired) by entomorphopathogenic fungi (those maddish fungi that grow in and on insects, speciifically the zombie ant one)

irl, in which itâ€™ll sprout and feed on the nervous system, replacing it, until the host is little more than a marionette shell. 
the primary motivation of the original mycelia in doing so is to gain physical actors and access to the world, even if these [[Crawlers]] are not very agile or dexterous.

the mycelia is believed to be highly intelligent, but it is impossible to engage in any communication, as it will quickly retaliate to any human approach. 
its widely believed that this single mycelium or fungus is not a single, continuous, entity or thing, but a network of several joined instances of this fungus, all communicating through networks spanning the size of several nations. this, regardless, makes it the single largest living entity known so far. 

this thing somehow then developed into what we know as the cluster in amida.
