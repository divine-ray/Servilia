things we like about LANCER: 
- mechs, obviously
- how they arranged the setting to walk the line between corpocracy hellscape and progressive, liberated utopia 
- nonhuman persons, who are probably best compared to [[Numerator|Numerators]] in our setting
	though, NHPs see use and application in processing-heavy portable applications like MECHs, aerial vehicles and spacecraft 
- approaching the entire trope of warp and ftl travel with a new twist of being a nonlinear dimension, through which tunnels and gates have been established 
- also the entire thing with entities in spaces and dimensions that do not translate to human perception
- the RA incident and siege of mars that willed itself into existence and then formally banned humanity from trying to transcend their bodies 
- whatever the fuck GALSIM and the five voices got going on 
- galactic-scale simulation and prediction of everything utilising nonlinear, paracausal cognition done by something I can only describe as a system of five consciousnesses, each with different duties or approach
we somewhat addressed our rendition of plurality/systemics in [[Subpersonas]] but those are more hands-on problem/task centered instead of a specific way of reason and thought 
I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if the lavish built some fat-ass organic-arcane hybrid cognition system for their purposes like prediction and general calcuation

los voladores as elusive, odd but also extremely advanced, pacifist culture/species/civilisation that just bumbles around the galaxy with no apparent objective outside of trading and gathering technological artifacts
