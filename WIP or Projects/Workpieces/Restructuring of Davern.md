Structure of the -units- reporting back to the [[New King]] of Davern;
there ought to be a organisation or some entity serving as research department or such, as their huge hoard of artefacts hides many secrets. 
They have been installed after [[The Old King]] and Ever-long Empress abdicated/perished. 
The Old King raised Davern into a formidable economic and societal position, now it is up to the [[New King]] to solidify and maintain this. 

Knowing that a rigid and harsh monarchy leads to unruliness he enabled organisations of their trade to propose minister candidates, whom the general public elect. 
Ex.: The Merchant's Association provides a few candidates for the trade-related ministry and subordinates and so on. 

Currently, their names are unknown, but roles are;
- Treasury and Trade
- Arcane Affairs
- Common and Public 
	This compartment unifies Health(care), Education, Infrastructure (which is partly located in T&T)
 - Exertion
	 Unifies Military, Diplomacy, Justice/Law.
