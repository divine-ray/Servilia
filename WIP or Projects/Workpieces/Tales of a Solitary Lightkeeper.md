"tales of a solitary lightkeeper" - stories and observations of an isolated lad on a lighthouse, protocolling all the weird and supernatural crap he witnesses 
his shifting sanity is sorta tied/related to the phases of [[Heaugi]], which directly impacts how he sees the events (but he failsto make the connection that he's bound to heaugi)
(such as [[07-14-05-31.01.25]], errant [[Weather Forecast]]s, 'ghost' ships, etc.)
