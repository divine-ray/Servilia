i really ought to design the [[Citadel of the Gear]] closer, especially the part around the heart
given that it's the main kinetic transmission of *all of capital thylyist* I have plenty of excuses and leeway for nefarious contraptions and other nonsense (like an auxiliary nuclear reactor plant)
the aesthetic of vintage story's Rust, with it's decayed machines but glowing runes is amazing, who doesn't love glowing magic goop flowing through insane piping 
	something like the blood of mekhane which is a concoction of organic blood, liquefied twilit essence, oil/coolant and lubricant 
the worm. the worm
i don't quite know how much I should go into body disfigurement horror here but I'd expect that the citadel does house some more practical applications of the cruelties (forced marriages)
maybe make their runes and engravings or similar magicy symbols look like part of the machinery
