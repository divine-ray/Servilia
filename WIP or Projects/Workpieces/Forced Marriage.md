The mekhanite procedure of placing a human mind and psyche into a machine or automaton is referred to as PENDING, and is arranged on a long term from a pool of uninformed candidates, which have exposed affiliations to the para/supernatural before. 
Unlike the procedure of [[Marriage]], this process is very violent and almost always against the will of the candidate. It involves the near-destruction of the host body, with only the nervous and cardiovascular system remaining. 

These people, or rather, their minds, have proven to be more suitable for being rearranged to pilot a machine, as their psyche is already exposed to unusual occurrences and can be worked into a machine easier.
