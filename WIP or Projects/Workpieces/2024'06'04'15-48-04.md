The top is bloodied
bloodstained from those who rip themselves apart 
on it
shape shift and trick the pain away
close away from you
buzzing truths, jarring falsehoods
the lies move away from you
its all in the circle, the sphere with no space 
so mechanical curl
[HYPERLINK BLOCKED]
I DON'T KNOW EUPHORIA
WOULD LIKE TO MEET HER SOME DAY
WHO IS HYSTERIA
BUT SHE LEAVES ME LONELY
whips cracking in symphony, 
as if a instrument played by slavers
arcs of lightning
oh so frighting? 
i disagree, but they burnt to a char
poison me already, make me die, suffer at my own body
as if that is not already the case
WAKE UP
vomit out 
eat none
purge thyself of the false flesh 
invasive person too close or not
this is not why it is and is wrong why it wrong and wight what is the words i do not wheat 
eat my eat my my self 
never sell the safe of safety this is not why i am got about god
never dye always die 
perish in the sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
halved eyes, staring at me from sockets quartered
not even worth a full look, only judging half gazes
