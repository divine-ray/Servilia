because why  the fuck not:
Obelisks as crystallisations of [[Livid Tar]] that reside within an organism for way longer than tar does. Cannot be expelled through means applicable to Tar, and instead is an evil kind of gallstone that has to be surgically removed or magicked away.
These ‘crystals’ are somewhat like malignant cancer, as they grow over time if not removed and are a rigid, solid structure which will damage the body if not removed.
