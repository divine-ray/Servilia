okay, there needs to be somenthing done about infantry-based weaponry against MECHs
or more general, ground-to-mech

i'm pretty sure that we can treat mechs, and moreso weapons against them, like tanks on earth but with a bit more smack

shaped charges and whatever the molten copper injection stuff was called sounds good for a start
possibly a launcher weapon that throws landmine-styled explosives intended to damage the undersides of a mech 

though designing weapons against x is hard when x is not done or tangible yet (lol) 
i think its fair to assume that heavier (tank/defender) mechs come with anti-munition systems like cwis or lasers, so projectile-based weapons maaay be less feasible
