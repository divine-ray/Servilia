the military of the bay confederation consists of brigades or some other major divisions who are trained, equipped and coordinated by each city independently 
Duley would primarily have airships and other aerial crafts, engineers/artillery and heavy mechanised units with some augmented soldiers sprinkled in
Brisbourne is obviously the naval fleet, in it's full breadth and depth
Frisco itself probably is common cavalry and infantry to that 

the science/military people are also very interested in using their development in combat and warfare, stuff like the OA-WS, protection wards, mobility (near-range rifting) and infused payloads
