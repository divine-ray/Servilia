idea for how amida-era tech advanced into blinkspace or ftl;
they managed to develop local, short-range spacetime/causality folding to ‘dash’/blink with vehicles (MECHs) or [[ORaNG-E-S]]
how these things manage to identify the boundaries or where to stop? special circuit-y embossment that weaves across the unit 
and yeah turns out that this prototype tech just shifts the demarked area (thus, vehicle or entity or entire buildings) into twilit/depthspace and back, and that process is (currently) horribly unstable and fucked up that location beyond all recognition (spacetime disruption turning it into a temporal/chromatic anomaly, folding into a [[Twilit Rift]] or [[Echoes|Echo]]?) 
but they did get enough data and information from that to refine this process and also realised it can be applied to larger vehicles like spacecraft
though it is unclear if this operation explicitly relies on the presence of a twilit shallow, generated from ignitions, or if it can work by shifting/lowering its depth on the celestial sea.
