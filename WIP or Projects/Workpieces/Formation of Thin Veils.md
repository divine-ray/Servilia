Some [[Thin Veil]]s are caused by traumatic memories, much like [[Echoes]] can manifest in certain locations. However, weave thinning is more tied to a larger area than echoes. Many thin veils found throughout the continent are caused by battlefields, memories of the [[Nølkā-Mekhanite War]] and [[Second Mekhanite War]]. 
Other ones were caused by deliberate practices and now-forgotten devices to disrupt enemy spellweavers.
