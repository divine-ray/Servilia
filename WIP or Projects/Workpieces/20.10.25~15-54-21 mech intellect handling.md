presuming that the intellect is hosted on some interchangeable, removable medium (cartridge, casket, whatever), with this medium providing potato glados type minimal support, that being standalone power, communication (radio/internet and acoustic) and maybe very simple locomotion 
ive decided to dub/call these caskets Thorax, because the thorax in animals is essential to living, and also contains the lungs

thoraxes are about as big as a large gas cylinder, but not nearly as heavy. can be carried by a regular person with some issue. 

given that C.1 and C.2 Intellects are partly organic, I’d assume that (along with [[Neural Matter of MECHs]]) the majority is derived from brain scans or digitisations of remarkable people or other previous intellects<br>
ie that these intellects are copied instances from said initial scan 

it is possible to modify the [[Throttling]] of one intellect/instance/cartridge on the fly
a higher throttle is restraining the intellect in its freedom on a multitude of levels 
factors as organic-age-equivalent, knowledge/memory, reason and logic, empathy or emotions etc.
a too high throttle will cause the subconscious (damage/trauma protection) routines of the thorax to engage, forcing the entire system into a comatose stasis until the throttle is loosened again
this process is very traumatic and damaging to the intellect and its consciousness if applied frequently or without proper preparations (informing the intellect about the higher throttle being impending etc.)
this measure or function was implemented to safely transport thoraxes and their intellects in an inert state and to possibly suppress undesirable or unpredictable intellect instances

thoraxes, when freshly instantiated (loaded with a blank scan) are in stasis by default until activated or hoisted into their chassis 

one intellect mainline idea is Cheerleader 
is extremely obsessed with the operator/pilot and very kawaii
