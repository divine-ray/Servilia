Chaos was the mother of the waters.
	The waters of the sea are salt; chaos moves within them.
		Nothing moves in nothing;
			Before something, there is nothing:
			Before the names of Heaven.
			Before the name of Earth.

Before the name of Heaven, before the name of Earth,
	Nothing moved in nothing.
		The waters of the sea were salt; chaos moved in them,
			Chaos was the mother of the waters.

Wrapped it about the corpse of chaos
	Made their many kingdoms of the earth
		And made white rock from the caps of all the waves.
			Chaos she raged; chaos she wept.

No field was formed, no marsh was to be seen;
	The gods were none of them called into being;
		None bore a name, no destinies were ordained;
				Chaos she coiled and the seas were salt.

Then came the names of things. Then were born the gods.
	Brightly burst in Heaven, writhing in the Earth,
		Dank and cold and moving in the deeps below.

The gods built walls to hold her out.
	Walls and walls: encircled were they all.
		Dynasties and kings, manners, places,
			They set the world in order. They stripped the seas.

Made them naked, saltless,
	Barren of the chaos of them,
		Put to use;
			Subdued them, bound them, chained the world;

Then did the chaos trash in the darkness.
	The chaos roared.
		She raised up her children, smote the gods:
			Answered the evil of them and the seas were salt.

It was grievous and she spat up this stone.
	Let none forget the words of the primal waters.
		Let them be remembered, sacred be;
			To those who forget them shall come worse things than salt:
Once, there was a maiden...
	Who cared for the sacred stone.
		She cleaned it, and polished it,
			And though she could not read
				Its words came unbidden to her lips.

The priest was afraid.
	He took the words from her lips.
		He cast the sacred thing upon the stones.
			The maiden stood upon the cliff:
				"The waters of the seas were salt," she says.

Everywhere was the noise of them
	And the noise of them was wrong.
