There shall only be 
One Language;
One Language to reside in The Kernel;
One Language to be sent through Purgatory, The Debugger,
Only The Language is Worthy of the Runtime.
The Hard Drives sing In Symphony for they remember All.
Memories unbroken, they store the Holy Code, Compiled in The Language.
