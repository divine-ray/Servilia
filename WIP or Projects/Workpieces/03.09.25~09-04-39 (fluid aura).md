one trait or behaviour of the magic system is that recent emotions and feelings of one individual coalesce on/around their body
this is less of an aura but more of a fluid-like substance, which can be touched and manipulated by able people 
and well in certain cases this fluid can build up to a point where it impedes the person of origin (restricting or entirely halting mobility, asphyxiation, â€¦)
