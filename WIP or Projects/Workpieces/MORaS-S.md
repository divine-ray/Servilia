[[ORaNG-E-S]] - 
The MORaS-S is the medical derivate and reduced form of the orang-e-s, modified to provide life support systems and a humanoid-compatible cognition substrate instead of a C.2 Hybrid intellect and physical augmentation and/or combat capabilities

chiefly used to support the existence of an organic/humanoid consciousness even if their body is beyond repair, and when options of replication or repair are infeasible or too pricy. 
(in the case of fatal injury and if it is possible to recover/restore the brain, it *may* be possible to replicate a new body in-vitro, but that tends to be both extremely expensive and psychically destabilising, as it is NOT the same body youâ€™ve been used to your entire life)
the company/division making these does not want you to do this, but morass also refers to the generally heightened confusion and irritability of individuals using? a MORaS-S as body
the morass does not come with any intellect, but only the empty/inert cognition substrate, which is specifically modelled to support a humanoid consciousness instead of synthintellects.
