The general studies of magics in [[Duley and Port]]/[[Frisco Bay Confederation|Bay Confederation]] would be best described as ‘The Scientists’ finding and investigating the rumours and old myths of magics, as several [[Phenomenon|Phenomena]] have raised their interest to the point where the [[Universities and Faculties of Duley]] have allocated resources to research this.
However, [[Nølkā|Nølkān]] refugees and the like have also stirred the interest of some less official and specialised groups in the wide public, which led to underground/"illicit" magick groupings. In some act of divine irony, they more or less reinvented/rediscovered both flesh-bending and mekhanite arts, eventually leading into the merge of both.
