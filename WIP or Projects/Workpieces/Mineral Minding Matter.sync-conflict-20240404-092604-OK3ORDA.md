Individual segments of [[Orb & Spire]] stones are capable of reacting to basic stimuli, whereas larger groups can coordinate movement and exhibit complex internal social dynamics between minerals of different kinds. 
This leads to the assumption of internal hierarchies and a linear advancement of complexity within as their mass grows.

Minerals of volcanic origin oftentimes expose themselves as the outer crust or hull of a accumulation, whereas sedimentary minerals comprise the internal structures.
Biogenic species^[such as calcium phosphate/carbonate, silicate, carbonates.] present within mineral groups typically act as actors and sensors, albeit slow for the human observer.
