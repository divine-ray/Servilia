The government and administration of Thylyist is divided into the following categories:
- Systems
	- Components
		- Parts
Systems are the top-most layer and span wide functions, for example, the [[Gearforged Vanguard]] is considered a System, which would be the military, in this case.
Components are sub-units of a System, typically branching out widely. Following the previous example, the [[Dogs of War]] and [[War Constructors]] are considered components of the Vanguard. 
Parts are singular cells, squads or offices of a Component.
