These foul spires, intertwined with their wicked veins.  Who knows what they're hiding in these? 
What forsaken abominations are being enslaved to be our very sustenance?
Everything here revolves around them, they define our nation and society. 
Irregular and twisted like bricks being stacked another recklessly and held together by these abominable arteries. And the light. The lighting follows you everywhere, there is not a single crevice left undone. Glaring and oversaturated do the advertisements scream for attention.
Little reach I can see, all is shrouded in the fumes and smoke.
Once more I- we- have to... think. What made us move here.. Certainly not any of those false promises of wealth or safety.
Gunfire is ringing out in the distance, distorted by echoing. 
This city, nation. It's nothing but a monolith to greed and ineptitude of the individual to scale the challenges thrown at them. Look around, what do you see?
