because I cannot get away from the olden trope of “classicism, but its magic“:
sorcerers are people who were born or conceived in extreme exposure to twilit

classicism<sup>2</sup>:  exposing a stillborn or newborn directly to the ocean (immersing or baptising them), which is more intense than a weave-born one

the curse of being innately bonded to weave/twilit manifests as the lack of conscious control over these powers, unlike weavers who disciplined themselves for wielding it. 
innates 

and for adult humans, drowning yourself in the ocean (or being thrown into the ocean as undying) with sufficient protection against corruption/warping and the wildlife has a fair chance of rebirthing your dead body into a greater form, something above humans. fused with the ocean, one can converse with the endless, listen to the rumbling tumbling waves of a sea of voices, see into the depths of the twilit and be seen by It



and then joe average who dedicated his life, mind and body to weaving and twilit


drowining in the [[Astral Ocean]] and subsequently the twilit has a chance of rebirthing the drowned person, if they won‘t be corrupted or devoured by the ‘life‘ in the ocean

this is possibly one alternative way to [[Ascension]], [[Rite of Ascension]]
as they say, many roads lead to the same goal
