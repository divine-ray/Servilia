new idea just sprouted;
highest potencies of spellcasting require you to permanently give up your body and instead use it as anchor/conduit to conduct energies and weave through an `installation`
NHP type stuff
analogy;
every being has an "overload switch" for magics, with the fail state being a suspended coma near-death
and getting installed effectively rams uncountable metaphysical hooks and wires into you and this switch for it to be forced in the open state, always

the mind, psyche and conscious is pried open from being a rivulet into becoming a powerful torrent, which rapidly erodes anything related to humanity to become a perfect stream bed 

eventually, the mind is so eroded and generally unrecognisable that it can not interact and be interacted with (by) other humans, at which point an intermediary translation construct is added
