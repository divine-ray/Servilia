to avoid the entire "magic people are supreme to the unenlightened masses" (which is a blatant white supremacy insert) I'll put the educated/bloodline folks into a situation where their extreme high standards is a big burden to them, compared to the hillbilly DIY sloppy style who doesn't need five security measures and ancient spellbooks

this entire trend of underground/"illicit" magics also led to the rediscovery/reinvention of flesh magics since living things (cattle and vermin) are very easy to come by, compared to sophisticated reagents and catalysts etc (especially in alchemistry and brewery)

Alchemistry and potion-brewing are usually done by people with broad access to less common plants, animals and their parts and other materials. 
Through this, certain agricultural folk and practices unknowingly perform magics.


Generally, the awareness and definition of *what magics is* is hardly defined by the governing authorities. This has pushed said authorities to perform nationwide surveys, resulting in a surprisingly widespread use of (lesser) magics among the civilian populace.
