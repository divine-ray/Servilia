to avoid the entire "magic people are supreme to the unenlightened masses" (which is a blatant white supremacy insert) I'll put the educated/bloodline folks into a situation where their extreme high standards is a big burden to them, compared to the hillbilly DIY sloppy style who doesn't need five security measures and ancient spellbooks

this entire trend of underground/"illicit" magics also led to the rediscovery/reinvention of flesh magics since living things (cattle and vermin) are very easy to come back compared to sophisticated reagents and catalysts etc
