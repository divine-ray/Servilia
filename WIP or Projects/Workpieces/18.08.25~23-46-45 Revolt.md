the execution of the [[Council of Thylyist]], burnt on stakes, their charred remains to be disassembled for the heretical devices they made us fear so much

we want this nation back!

something about the burning bodies of the dictatorship 
also, they’re most likely very conscious about their suffering due to the 2950 life enhancing devices and bullshit they ate
but I do wonder how they got overthrown if not for the machine and machinists directly 

the visions of their/someone’s guts splattered over the corner of a courtyard wall, their palace, their holy domain
polished and pristine, but watered with the blood of so many many innocent people 
in the name of his divine reassembly
in vain 

no, death or undeath is too kind for these, we shall force their souls to reside within coffins of their own making, for them to watch for eons to come upon the world that they wrought with their own searing hatred 
watch powerlessly as their achievements they oh so violently tended to and watered with blood wilt, decay and get systematically rooted out by the true machinists
