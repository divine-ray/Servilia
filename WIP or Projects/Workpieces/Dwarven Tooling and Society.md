[[Dwarves]] are born or fitted after birth with hardened steel drilling and crushing implements, which is vital for their diet of deconstructing/oxidizing minerals on molecular layer. 
originally designed by the lavish as a one-size-fits-all solution, but they deviated from this intent by adapting to the local mineral formations and subsequently forming tribes.

they are organised in a eusocial system dividing between miners, forgers and artisans.
Miners are the strongest and toughest of all, being required to process up to a cubic meter of solid rock and ore per day. 
Forgers are built to endure constant exposure and occasional contact of the [[Searing Lode]] to process the bulk ore into purified metals and alloys.
