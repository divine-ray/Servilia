[[Dwarves]] are born or fitted after birth with hardened steel drilling and crushing implements, which is vital for their diet of deconstructing/oxidizing minerals on molecular layer (lithophages). 
They are ”born” with frail and poor-quality raw iron parts, with the process of refining these is considered both a marking for coming of age and a lifelong journey to find the optimal alloy composition for itself. 
originally designed by the lavish as a one-size-fits-all solution, but they deviated from this intent by adapting to the local mineral formations and subsequently forming tribes.

The embossment and general treatment of their scales, plating and exoskeleton has a high value in their social system. 



they are organised in a eusocial system dividing between miners, forgers and artisans.
Miners are the strongest and toughest of all, being required to process up to a cubic meter of solid rock and ore per day. 
Forgers are built to endure constant exposure and occasional direct contact of the [[Searing Lode]] to process the bulk ore into purified metals and alloys.
Artisans are the most nimble and dexterous of this species, being dedicated to working alloys and metals into usable tools, body parts and machinery.
