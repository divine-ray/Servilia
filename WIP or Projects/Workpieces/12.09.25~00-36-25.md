NHGHHHH 
scape and run!! parasite bullshittery 
well
is it time for the third [[16.09.25~23-49-22 Red Plague x Mushroom Rewrite]]/addon of [[Red Plague]]? 
otherwise I fail to come up with something that doesnt directly intersect with the red plague 
ie warping flesh and bones into the most fucked up creatures you’ve ever seen
though, we hardly have elaborated on the consequences of the [[Lavish Wastes]] because, well, that chaos or whatever corruption coming from the fountainhead borehole 
†

and more exclusion zones to justify why there are zero nations outside of the known one are also good 👍 
as I would assume that [[10.09.25~17-17-17 Cluster Mushrooms]] does warrant an exclusion zone or at least a “do not fucking enter if you like living” 
[[16.09.25~23-49-22]]
