The [[Exploration Board]] has approved and authorised, in cooperation with the [[Esoteric  Engineers]], a series of experimentation relating to [[Using Thin Veils]].
These experiments require construction of copies of the biggest train stations in the [[Frisco Bay Confederation|Confederation]] in threadbare areas. 
Grounds for this series is the speculation and derived hypothesis that [[Ghost Stations]] are stations from different timelines or those that have once been there, therefore acting as. fainted [[Leyline]] node. 

Observation protocols are documented under [[Ghost Station Experiments. Protocol ].
