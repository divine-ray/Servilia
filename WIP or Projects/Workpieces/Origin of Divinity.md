some people in eons before the covered timespan formed such a tight bond with a concept or energy that it strangled their humanity, replacing it, turning them into the physical avatar of this concept/energy/whatever.
somewhen, two of the major forces (creation in metal, tools and destructifon in flesh, beasts) seeded their followers to an arms race to power.
the metal-folks are out of scope rn, but the beast people learnt to bend flesh and everything living to their whim, eventually ramping up their bloodlust that a normal being doesnâ€™t suffice. instead, god-avatars were sought out and devoured in bloody feasts, along with the promise that devouring the avatar would allow the eater to become the devoured, i.e. gain their powers
