Report of a Broken Face
If only you know how much better things could be
Across the border, is this what you came here for?
Only a broken face, a broken man?
Nothing to be seen, only to be heard, falling on deaf eyes and blind ears. 
Tied down with cables, wouldnâ€™t that be as binding a living one with their own entrails
The sugar is always sweet, but it takes its tax in the end. 
Poison in every thing.
