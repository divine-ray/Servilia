storyline: "[[Downfall of Thylyist]]"
---
we’ve agreed now that frisco is destined to grow into amida - but somewhere in the process they (have to) acquire the knowledge and skills of arcane engineering of the [[Followers of Mekhane|Mekhanite]] variety. how?
how? well, frisco is actively involved in the conflicts that will lead to Thylyist dying, and in the process they surely disassemble/annex every single thing and concept that isn’t destroyed by the mekhanites committing self-immolation in the face of defeat. 
im currently projecting several reasons for the [[Downfall of Thylyist]] directly stemming from Frisco;
- industrial/military espionage
- trade or direct military warfare
- instigating revolution and instability 
- ruining Thylyist’s supplies through their aerial and naval superiority
