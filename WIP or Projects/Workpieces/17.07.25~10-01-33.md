storyline: "[[Downfall of Thylyist]]"
---
we’ve agreed now that frisco is destined to grow into amida - but somewhere in the process they (have to) acquire the knowledge and skills of arcane engineering of the [[Followers of Mekhane|Mekhanite]] variety. how?
im currently projecting several reasons for the [[Downfall of Thylyist]] directly stemming from Frisco ;
- industrial/military espionage
- trade or direct open warfare
- instigating revolution and instability 
- ruining Thylyist’s supplies through their aerial and naval superiority
