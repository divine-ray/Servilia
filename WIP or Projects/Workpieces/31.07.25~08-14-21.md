[[Network 24); DROPTABLE]] runs a successful assassination on a high-ranking individual among the corpocracy and leaves a [[UCI Cube]] (universal crystal interface, extremely dense data storage) on their corpse
the cube contains a synthesised, digital virus which would immediately seed several million instances across its networking reach and then use the acquired botnet to brute force calculate its way into deeper hardware levels
and obviously the police ([[ISONS]]) plugs the cube into the UCI of the investigation group's [[G.32-GUARDDOG]], where the GUARDDOG fails to virtualize/contain it properly and silently gets hijacked 


GUARDDOG units are pony-sized Restricted class quadrupedal MECHs, exclusively assigned for bodyguarding and personal protection duties. typically, ISONS patrols consist of two humanoids and a GUARDDOG. they're equipped with claws, a maw and a low-powered Kinetics firearm.
GUARDDOG units are weakly linked to the local numerator's security subpersona. this link can be overridden with [[protocol :: SEIZE]], which puts all weakly linked MECHs into direct control of the numerator.
