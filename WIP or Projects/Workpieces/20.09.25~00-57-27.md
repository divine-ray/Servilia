the people partaking in spellcasting and Weave are met with visions and nightmares/dreams that somehow convey geometric patterns to them and urges or motivates them to carve these patterns into their skin or otherwise place them on or near their body (to enhance conductivity) (another explanation why people tend to go insane (nightmares of selfharm) and also why the patterns are there)

this phenomenon also occurs in the people who worked on [[11.08.25~12-58-03 (blinkspace)]] mechs, which is why depthspace proof mechs are always embossed with circuit-like patterns out of special alloy stuff
