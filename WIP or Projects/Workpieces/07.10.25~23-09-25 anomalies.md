# anomalies
assuming that we have the [[weave]] doing all sorts of irregularities, i would assume that it also spawns distinct anomalies
shit like [[Ghost Stations]], gravity wells, discolouration ([[THE WHITE WOODS]]), possibly transforming (small) bodies of water to be direct access-es to the astral ocean, temporal dilation, ye goode ole fire/lightning ball, [[Echoes]]
actually, echoes are their own kind of anomaly come to think of it
