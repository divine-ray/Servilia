some chap who is just grumpled up with his work in the citadel, tired of having to do all these ridiculous routines (he knows what'd be appropriate)

the barkeep of [[SICK]], theyre nose deep in the gossip and not afraid to make use of that 

a lad who has been chosen by the gods or something to be the [[New King]] to Davern, but he *really* does not want to, to the point where his hesitation and the force applied is soulcrushing to him and the royal court, but hilarious to any outsider.

the former leaders of both [[Followers of Mekhane|Mekhanites]] and [[Nølkā]] (from back in the day of The War) are still "alive", but their corpses/husks suspended in time, forced to observe the consequences of their massacring and marauding

a wandering nolkan priest who has mostly abandoned their belief and local community (but kept their mods), is now on the search for the true history of the [[War]] to resolve their inner peace
he might become the one who unwillingly causes a last armed conflict to finally resolve the troubles between the mekhanites and remaining nolka
