THE WOODS
THE WHITE WOODS
[[Witches]] IN THESE WOODS
***
So, in short, the [[Fountainhead]]'s corruption extended to a one-off river branch, which was sprouting from the heart of the [[Ninth Forest]], and thus corrupted a piece of that landscape, devouring the colour of that forest, turning it white-grey-black. 
and somehow, a few outcasts from the [[Long Savannah]] have managed to tap and exploit these powers, at the cost of their sanity and general social acceptance.
Given their inheritance and legacy, they have adapted to traverse the ninth forest, or what remains after the corruption, on horseback.
***
An unknown amorphous organism that has spread throughout the waterways of section of the ninth forest, infesting one [[Worldship Nemus|Nemus]] and warping it to provide a shell to this organism, turning it to the core of the white woods.
