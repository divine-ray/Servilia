grand pump station 
place through which [[Empire of Thylyist|Thylyist]]s water supply is distributed, relatively adjacent to the citadel to ease the mechanical transmission 
it's a relatively tall building, high enough to be seen across the roofs from ground level
an ungodly amount of pipes join and divert here, most of which are underground but some, smaller (still larger than humans) pipes run aboveground 
routing is fully automatic and done by a mechanism so complex that it's unofficially considered to be one of Mekhane's parts
