i somehow wanna integrate the aesthetics of 1970s-80s technology, industryÂ and machinery into the development process of [[Frisco Bay Confederation]] as it moves from their era of industrial revolution and onset to the far future known as [[Amida]], and mayyyybe ursurp or defeat [[Empire of Thylyist|Thylyist]] in the process?

specifically all the interfaces and machinery that use lamps, knobs and buttons and nixies to be interacted with, and not desk-spanning flatscreens with terran horrors like UI design and *programming*
