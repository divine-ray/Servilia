Some incident at [[Arcane and Anomalous Studies]] a few years prior to the [[Development of Printing]] caused a runaway reaction on a group of stray cats, granting them elevated social skills and the ability to directly communicate with Humans. 
This group of cats eventually founded [[The Cats' Scriptorium]], which subsequently monopolised printing.
