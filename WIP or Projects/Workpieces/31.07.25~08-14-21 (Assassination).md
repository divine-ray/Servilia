[[Network 24); DROP TABLE]] runs a successful assassination on a [[high-ranking individual]] among the corpocracy and leaves a [[UCI Cube]] (universal crystal interface, extremely dense data storage) on their corpse
the cube contains a synthesised, digital virus which would immediately seed several million instances across its networking reach and then use the acquired botnet to brute force calculate its way into deeper hardware levels (inspired by https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/coding-machines/)
and obviously the police ([[ISONS]]) plugs the cube into the UCI of the investigation group's [[G.32-GUARDDOG]], where the GUARDDOG fails to virtualize/contain it properly and silently gets hijacked
