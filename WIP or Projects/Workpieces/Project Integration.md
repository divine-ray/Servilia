- we have the decaying, rotting bodies of god-avatars around, some big enough to act as small island-groups when skeletised
- we got a large roster of synthetic species, some of which are actively detrimental to human activities (steel-eating beaver)
- we got a natural nuclear reactor, which, together with a magic-y hearth/hotspot, transformed a forested grassland into a savannah-desert
- there’s an ice heart that froze an entire region into glaciers, snow/ice plains and tundra
- uhh
- surely a continent-sized particle accelerator has some influences on the environment


with the fall of the lavish, the Palga lake did not get drained initially, but all their machinery to maintain the water at a constant state friendly to the lavish and their machinery as well
