yep I think the time for [[12.09.25~00-36-25]] has come, i want to rewrite or majorly edit the red plague or *another factor, perhaps?* to act as source for fucked up flesh monsters
though! I just realised that S&R:P’s “parasites” are frankly only relevant for the first few bits of the theme, then they fall off due to game mechanic spawning
in our setting, the parasite or overtaking bit should come from devouring or assimilating existing biomass (non-plant larger lifeforms) and then applying the fleshbending to create said fucked up flesh monsters
so maybe the [[Red Plague]] as we described it is closer to an unfinished, disjointed and poorly coordinated shape, solely driven by hunger and hatred, instead of a coordinated and conscious mind and approach housed in deliberately shaped and made vessels (entities) 

ok the above is now canon
possibly the nolka were never as good in fleshbending as they were seen and known as, hence why the majority of their *creations* were lumped piles of blood and mass
this probably had a similar runaway and out of control situation as with [[Songbird]]s, as songbirds aswell were too autonomous to be handled by their creators
but unlike songbirds, this did contribute a great amount of peril and general KILL to their makers
given this perspective, I would consider it quite likely that the red plague is what killed them (and not the [[Second Mekhanite War]]), or at least dealt the killing blow

okay, idea just struck
the inciting moment where the red plague graduated from its stupid, dumb and primal hunger to becoming cognisant and somewhat self-aware is though exposure to [[10.09.25~17-17-17 Cluster Mushrooms]] spores and subsequent fusion of the mycelia network and the flesh

this is mass and blood, given soul and design
