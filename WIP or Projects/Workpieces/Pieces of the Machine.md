Every piece in the machine knows its place. 
Each knows where it belongs, and which responsibility it carries for the whole.
Each component remembers who carved them from the blank, who conceived them on the drawing board. 
And to all, they work together, destined for their purpose, united in their load. 
	They share the stress, the twisting and turning of the woeful forces dragging and pulling on their whole, yet on every single piece at once. 
The bolt knows where it belongs, it has been inscribed into it's very body: the threading fits into the bored mount, which itself is riveted onto another piece.
In the machine, they all work together.
Or fail together at their weakest moment.
