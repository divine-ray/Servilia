# Theoretical application of fissile material to drive machinery
~~What if the [[Raising]] of the hollow mountains also exposed a potent uranium deposit, to the scale of a natural reactor?~~ 
 Now canon, see:
	-> [[Searing Lode]]
this also might have aided in the desertification and climate shift of the [[Long Savannah]] since geothermally heated groundwater dried up the surface.
additionally, surface breaches of such pressurised and heated water made way for the [[Steam Gardens]], a unique and equally extreme ecosystem defined by it's intense geysir activity and displaced minerals.
