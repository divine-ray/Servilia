The [rust](Rust.md) comes, the rust corrodes, and it goes. 
What death and undying is to man is the rust to machine and metal.
It cannot be evaded, it is eternal. 
One can only hold valiant attempts bound to failure to hold off the rust. 
In [[Mekhane|His]] absence, all that is metal has lost its perseverance. 
The rust will come for all that is metal and take it to the corroded world. 
Machines are torn asunder by the rust, unable to resist through the power of His presence. 

[[Pieces of the Machine]] are rendered apart, 
To be rebuilt together with the undying flesh, 
Reborn into abominations defiant of the Ideals of Two. 

The rust and the [[Red Plague|plague]] united in an [[Forced Marriage|unholy union]], sent to terrorise and kill in an endless thirst for vengeance,
To avenge and undo their creators, who gave birth to each, unjust and unasked for.
