## Intelligence Classifications
The Intelligence piloting a mobile combat unit is classified under three categories:
1. Autonomous
	 Fully independent cognition, capable of reasoning and own actions. 
 2. Restricted
	 Limited cognition, able to execute complex tasks but not capable of improvising.
 3. Hybrid
	 A subclass of 1.: Autonomous, these systems are oriented around providing assistance to a humanoid pilot, but can steer the unit with little to decent flexibility on its own.
4. Blind, Deaf, Dumb (BDD)
	 Barely considered intelligent, these units fully require a pilot to function.  
## Overarching Classes
MECHs (==mobile entity combat hybrids==) fill these roles:
- oversized exoskeleton, piloted by soldiers (BBD)
- main battle tank equivalent on six/eight legs, autonomous entity with rationale intellect
- scout unit using digitigrade bipedal stride, barely armoured but extremely agile, hybrid piloting (soldiers + AI)
- Troop Transport and APC in a quadruped frame, steered by a autonomous intelligence
- Heavy biped BDD, doubling as main battle unit.
- quadrupedal restricted + pilot recon/stealth unit, lightly armed, designed for agility and stealth
- Hexapod/octopedal insectoid unit with restricted cognition, primarily for handling cargo and logistics. 
	Can raise up its two front limbs to act as manipulators (Like a forklift). 
- Feline-oriented sniper unit using restricted intel, quadrupedal stride. 
- Digitigrade bipedal unit for close-quarter melee combat. AI/Hybrid.
