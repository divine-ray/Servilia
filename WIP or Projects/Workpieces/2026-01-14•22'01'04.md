given the branding sourcing from [[semi sacred geometry]] and weaver prosthetics, I would not be surprised if weavers (magic users) dress in heavy cloaks or armour to obscure their branding

trying hard to develop the weavers from frisco, as they’re pretty damn pivotal to the entire academic and technological progress 

them wearing cloaks or armour would be contradicting the fact that they’re pretty high up and renown for their skills

its hard for me atm to not lean too much into skong silk and weave here, but thats mainly since my current definition of weave is lackluster
ughe
I know that weave is-
idea!
if twilit is the depth/substance of the astral ocean, then weave is the seafoam and spray that floats atop, overlaying terrain and occasionally manifesting [[Leyline]]s

and the reason why humans use weave way more than the (stronger) is the ease of accessibility
weave is just out there to grasp and form, whereas twilit requires you to immerse in the ocean to draw on it

though the entire water and ocean theme does kinda collide with the principle of resistive heat, maybe I should emphasise tar mor, or have other adverse effects as well
given that both weave and twilit are associated to liquid, maybe it throws waves who either are constructive (benevolent, harmonic) or destructive (malignant, dissonant)
and being exposed to dissonant waves- ha! - generates physical heat through molecular vibrations and whatnot
so its a matter of aligning your weaving to the waves, in order to not die 
maybe the harmonic waves are actually required, since the constructive effect amplifies the casted weave to the point where its usable, otherwise it’d be just a glimmer

presumably destructive waves are responsible for generating [[Livid Tar]] too, which might even cause a feedback cycle if not controlled properly
which is why many proficient weavers augmented themselves with tar release mechanisms, some device capable of extracting tar from the bloodstream, for it to be disposed of later
the invention and deployment of these external pump-filters was a major breakthrough in expanding the human capacity for working weave
