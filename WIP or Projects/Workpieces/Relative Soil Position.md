those above the soil = songbirds and [[robot angels]]/[[Warped Angel]]
those beneath the soil = [[Dwarves]], â€¦[[Crystalbearers]] and other hollow mountain critters
the soil is both the solid ground, regular soil and rock and all that but also bound to the [[weave]], sorta acting as barrier to the first twilit layers, perhaps
and it just so happens that the hollow mountain excavations are the deepest points known across the continent, and are known for their [[Thin Veil]] and weave, causing issues.
