A pair of glaring eyes piercing through the veil of the night, 
[[cloaked in shadows]], they are aware of their observer, 
staring into the unfortunate soul which ends caught in their glimpse. 
They know what you did; what sins you committed; whom you saved; whom you betrayed.
With thine eyes we see all.
These eyes are yours. 
A blink, and they‘re gone. 

What will you make of this unlikely concurrence?
Will you change your ways, knowing what you have done?
Or will you carry on living your life, pretending to be innocent?#
