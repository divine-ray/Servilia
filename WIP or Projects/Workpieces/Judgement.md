A pair of glaring [[There’s Eyes in my Water|eyes]] piercing through the veil of the night, 
[[Shadows Woven]], they are aware of their observer, 
staring into the unfortunate soul which ends caught in their glimpse. 
They know what you did; what sins you committed; whom you saved; whom you betrayed.
With thine eyes we see all.
These eyes are yours. 
A blink, and they‘re gone. 

What will you make of this unlikely concurrence?
Will you change your ways, knowing what you have done?
Will you carry on living your life, pretending to be innocent?
Will you deny any wrongdoings, casting off your mistakes and guilt like a used glove?
This glove will come alive, One Day, and seek you out to choke you. 
![[One Day]]
