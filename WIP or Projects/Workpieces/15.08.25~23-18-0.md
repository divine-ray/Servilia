what if the lavish or other yet unknown species left some kind of ascension guideline behind
which pretty much details in a species-, culture-, language-, agnostic/decoupled matter
and or possibly like the nuclear waste warning messages 
maybe even in relation to the searing lode

set aside I would love to have some bits like that as grand puzzle hunt strewn across the stellar neighbourhood 
possibly to the point where the civilisation that left these was kinda like RA/MONIST-1 but instead they incentivise ascension or transcending beyond a corporal form, along with all the ridiculous technologies associated
for starters itâ€™d justify/explain [[13.08.25~20-47-35 (ai computing)]] aka having a GALSIM type system, though a nigh omniscient thing like that seems mildly pointless in plot terms, if not outright contra-productive
