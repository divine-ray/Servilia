Neverland: A land that `never was / never is / never will be`.
Dreams are one of the few things that differ humanity from beasts, from animals; It empowers them and offers guidance, but never speaks clearly. 
To this day, citizens of every nation and woodlanders alike have been dreaming, but the art of interpreting and understanding has been lost. 
Yet it is so clear, the wispy, willowy voices and images, everyone remembers it. You remember what you dreamt. 
Nobody knows.

Nobody but one ::

Only then, when the body and mind give up their greedy, falsely protective grasp, only then is the soul allowed to roam, to explore the possibilities, to take vacation from this singular plane of existence.  
Only then it is possible to shatter the shackles that the body and mind bind the soul with, only in our dreams we are truly free. 

Isn’t everyone a planestrider in their own right, then?
