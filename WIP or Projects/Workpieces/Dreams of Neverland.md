Neverland: A land that `never was / never is / never will be`.
Dreams are one of the few things that differ humanity from beasts, from animals; It empowers them and offers guidance, but never speaks clearly. 
To this day, citizens of every nation and woodlanders alike have been dreaming, but the art of interpreting and understanding has been lost. 
Yet it is so clear, the wispy, willowy voices and images, they remember it. You remember what you dreamt. 
Nobody knows.

Nobody but one ::

Isnâ€™t everyone a planestrider in their own right, then?
