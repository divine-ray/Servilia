[[Empire of Thylyist|Thylyist's]] main means of urban transportation are attempting-to-not-be-whimsical overhead-mounted rails for carts and carriages for transporting large cargo and people, and pneumatic tube of varying parallel standards carry smaller goods and valuables. 
	Most of the pneumatic tubes have their junctions and routing operated by humans, some are prototyping mechanical routing, with destination defined by a pattern of holes. The holes and patterns are set from a set of fixable rings at the front segment of the capsule. This system is primitive, and does not hold up for large capacity, but it's promising. 
Screw elevators/conveyors are widely used for transporting loose bulk and fluids/liquids, like water, grain, sand and such. 
Pipes for liquids are not entirely filled with a screw the entire length, but instead pressurised at pump stations using screws.
