Participation Papers (shortened to parper) as the[[Frisco Bay Confederation|Confederation]]'s equivalent of stocks and shareholds.
These papers are each their own document and treated similar to bank notes, in the sense that the holder owns them and the represented value.
as a means of theft protection, newly issued Parpers are tied to their owner and loose validity in case of any transfer attempt.
they are issued by the Friscoan government to the companies owners and leaders, who'll distribute them to potential buyers
however, each parper transaction is overseen by the administration to prevent hostile overtaking (this is a fairly recent development after [[Frisco Universal Oil]] made several threatening advances using buyouts)
