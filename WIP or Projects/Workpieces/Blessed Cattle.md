It was slaughter day.
A year has since passed, and it was time for these cows to meet the knife. 
The priest was here, and he has given his ointments. 
They could see what was coming for them, but the atmosphere and blessing calmed them.
The butcher uncoiled his rope, and started to tie them down, one by one.
It was not for long, until all cattle were restrained but suspended in a haze from the incense in their pens on the marketplace. 
Unnamed helpers draped a freshly woven mat of fabric onto the slaughter bench and prepared vessels to collect possible spills. 
The first one was hauled by the strongest men onto the bench, accompanied with rhyming intonations from the priest, assuring this one a swift death and safe transfer into the afterlife. 
The butcher drew his blade and needle, presenting it to the barely-conscious animal, as a gesture of honesty and fair play. 
As if it knew, it closed its eyes in a blink, and with a swift move of steel, life and soul were ready to depart from the animal. 
The priest raised his voice and opened one of the four clay vessels, decorated and engraved. This was to give the soul a safe residence until it decides to truly depart. 
This procedure was repeated three more times. 
The now lifeless corpses were hauled away, one by one, for butchering. 
All four clay vessels were placed on the corners of the bloodied bench, with their lids leaning open. 

It was a good day.
