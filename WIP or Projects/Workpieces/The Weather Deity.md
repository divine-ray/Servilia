The weather deity, survivor of [[Theophagy|Death of Divinity]]. Rather, they have reformed from its [[Corse]] into what It is now, the four faces of the skies;
Wet - Dry - Fast - Slow. 
Steam, sand, foot of hare, shell of snail. 
Each face is trapped in an eternal emotion,
Sadness - Anguish - Rejoice - Relaxed. 
Sat upon the high clouds, they turn and twist themselves, governing the winds and rains. 
It has recombined itself from its corse, as the weather is universal; it does never leave. The people always believe in the weather. 
Or do they believe in the tall tales they are told by the [[Weather Forecast]]?
