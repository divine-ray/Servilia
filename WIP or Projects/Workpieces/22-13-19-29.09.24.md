this is supposed to be the canonisation of redoing the map. Since the chronology is not fixed either it could as well be a catastropic event tied to [[Possible reasons why Schi-Ut-Pula vanished]], demarking the zeroth to first era transition. 
It also would justify the dramatic territory losses on everyone's behalf, since [[Death of the Countryside through Teleportation]] could never reach nation-wiping magnitudes. 
However, since we don't want to scrap this entire project, i'll have to apply some Magic Sauce:tm: to somehow keep the entire cast and setup through this - apparently - very violent and destructive transformation.
