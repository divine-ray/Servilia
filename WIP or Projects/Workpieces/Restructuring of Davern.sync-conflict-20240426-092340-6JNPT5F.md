Structure of the -units- reporting back to the New King of Davern;
there ought to be a organisation or some entity serving as research department or such, as their huge hoard of artefacts hides many secrets. 
They have been installed after [[The Old King]] and Everlong Empress abdicated/perished. 
the old King raised Davern into a formidable economic and societal position, now it is up to the [[New King]] to solidify and maintain this. 
Currently, their names are unknown, but roles are;
- Treasury and Trade
- Magicks/arcane affairs
- Common and Public 
	This compartment unifies Health(care), Education, Infrastructure (which is partly located in T&T)
 - Exertion
	 Unifies Military, Diplomacy, Justice/Law.
