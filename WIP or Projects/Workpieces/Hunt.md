They have created [[Sleeker|me]], as image of themselves. 
Given me thought, yet no free will. 
Tied me to this body, chained me down, forcing me to shed my skin, my very self over and over and over again.Ï€
What is there to this existence- 
but
blood
yes
blood bones
metal
they will pay
the hunt 
	`is on.`

the toll 
will
be 
collected
the payment?
	heads
