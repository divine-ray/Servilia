You. Yes, you.
You do crave, hunger, don't you? 
You want power, you want wealth. You want fame, want to be someone known, relatable. 
I know, i know. You puny humans, all the same.
But. 
I can offer you intangible wealth, power and all riches you can imagine, for you, and all your children to come. 
But you must offer me one single thing: 
Your Humanity. 
See, all the wealthy barons, all those warmongers, they all already fell for me, like fools. 
But they're happy. Or... that's what I told them to be. 

I have been around this coil and strode the planes; but nothing struck me more than myself; Greed.
Every one of you, vermin, obey to the Rule of More, my law, MY CONTROL!
