Thereâ€™s a scar on [[Valerie|my]] knee
If i were to tore it up
Cold metal, resting under warm tissue
Cold metal of blade meeting warm steel and flesh
Which phantom did i invoke?
What are the spirits that live, reside in me, those that turn the gears in this chassis?
It is not a chassis, I am a carcass of metal, with flesh draped across it. 
This is not something i ever envisioned, I do not Want To Be *This*. 
Oh, the pain, however. It strikes through my mind, drags me across halls of sharpened blades, screaming at me in anguish,
bleeding, screaming, thrashing, refusing but wanting to finally give out - 

Yet. I remain.
It is a part of me, but i do not let it take control over the cowering, cornered animal that my / our humanity has been reduced to. It, the animal, seeks an escape route, it wants to flee, yet it cannot escape this steeled cage facing head-on to its demise, the butcher.

The butcher always comes dressed fancy, he knows that his actions are all game and play. Those who fall for his masquerade and trickery end. 

There, within my thigh, my body, the phantom
It has been here before, before the metal came and took my flesh
It knows a language 
that I used to speak
before i had a tongue
before i was born.
`//WHERE///ARE//WE//`

let it rest, let it in
it likes the metal, the clicking of clockwork, the enigmatic mechanism 
it finds joy in the craftsmanship of Man, it cherishes the effort taken to
to
take my leg
our legs.
