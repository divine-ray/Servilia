Some autonomous vehicles ([[MECH Units]]) source their intellect/conscious from dissolving a regular human, forcibly 'uploading' their consciousness into a machine. 
The more common practice places a humanoid at the centre of a MECH and is then fused with the machineâ€™s systems.
In-vitro or from-nothing neural mass is exceedingly rare but vastly more capable than humanoid cerebral tissue. Units granted own and unique cognition typically inhabit the highest ranks and levels, much closer to [[Numerator]]s than common battlefield units.
