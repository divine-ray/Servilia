Some autonomous vehicles ([[MECH Units]]) source their intellect/conscious from assimilating a regular human, forcibly 'uploading' their consciousness into a machine. 
The more common practice places a humanoid at the centre of a MECH and is then fused with the machine’s systems.
Commonly referred to as marriage, as it binds both sides together into a somewhat symbiotic, if abusive dynamic. 
The human psyche can’t undergo this process unharmed, which is why freshly wed MECHs require a certain honeymoon period to allow the machine and human to come to terms with another. 
Those minds that try to fight and gain the upper hand in this situation are readily shattered and broken; leading to the psyche being waste that the machine needs to dispose of. Those cases are rarer, as it leads to the machine having a fresh organic core to overwrite. 

In-vitro or from-nothing neural mass is exceedingly rare but vastly more capable than humanoid cerebral tissue. Units granted own and unique cognition typically inhabit the highest ranks and levels, much closer to [[Numerator]]s than common battlefield units.
