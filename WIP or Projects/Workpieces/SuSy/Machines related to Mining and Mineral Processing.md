# Heading
(I primarily want to focus on multiblocks for their perceived modularity and less bloat of single blocks for every tier)
## Extraction
![[Extraction (SuSy)]]

## Refining and Processing
### Comminution
Mechanical Refining refers to the processing of reducing the size of ore; synonymous to comminution which means 'To reduce to minute particles, pulverize'[^dictionary]
Technically speaking, the process of mining could be considered as mechanical refining as well, since those operations break down deposits and sediments, often several kilometres in size, into boulders and rocks that can be shipped. 
Crushing and milling are dry operations (i.e. with minimal liquid involved) whereas grinding is exclusively performed as wet operation or even as slurry or suspension. 
#### Primary Crushing
Primary grinding is the initial step of crushing ores and solid sediments after they have been mined, typically resulting in grain sizes of 150-300mm (Gravel).
This stage typically operates using compressive force to break apart the fed material.

- [[Cone Crusher]]
#### Secondary Crushing
Results in grain sizes of less than a centimetre, the size of pebbles and very coarse sand.
- [[Gyratory Crusher]]
- [[High-Pressure Grinding Roll Crusher]]
#### Tertiary Crushing (Milling)
This stage is primarily applied before chemical treatment such as floatation and leaching. 
Averages 100-500µm per run (very fine sand to silt).[^circuits]

## Sorting
### Sizing
These machines sort larger grain feedstock based on their size.

[^circuits]: Crushers, especially these mills, arrange individual machines in series or loops in combination with separation machines to achieve these very fine particulates.
