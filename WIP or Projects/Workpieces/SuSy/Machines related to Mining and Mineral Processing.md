# Heading
(I primarily want to focus on multiblocks for their perceived modularity and less bloat of single blocks for every tier)
## Extraction
To have some tangible value to digging up the ground for minerals, the concept and implementation of ores has to be overhauled. The following assumes that such changes have taken place. 
### Rocks And Ores

#### Vertical Mining Rig
Guh? 
Maybe deploys some sort of silly mechanical worm that eats up the ores

### Sediments
### Liquids and Fluids

## Refining
### Mechanical R. 
Mechanical Refining refers to the processing of reducing the size of ore. 
#### Primary Crushing
Primary grinding is the initial step of crushing ores and solid sediments after they have been mined, typically resulting in grain sizes of 150-300mm (Gravel).
- Jaw
- Cone
#### Secondary Crushing
Results in grain sizes of less than a centimetre, the size of pebbles and very coarse sand.
- Gyratory
- HPGR/Roll
#### Teritary Crushing (Milling)
This stage is primarily applied before chemical treatment such as floatation and leaching. 
Averages 100-500Âµm per run (very fine sand to silt).^[Crushers, especially these mills, arrange individual machines in series to achieve the desired grain size.]
- Vertical Shaft Impactor
- Ball or Semi-Autogenous
- (For a slurry suspension:) IsaMill
## Sorting
### Sizing
These machines sort large-grained feedstock based on their size.
- Sluice
- Rotating *Trommel*
