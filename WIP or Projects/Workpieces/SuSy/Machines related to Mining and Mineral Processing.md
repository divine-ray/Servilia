# Heading
(I primarily want to focus on multiblocks for their perceived modularity and less bloat of single blocks for every tier)
## Extraction
![[Extraction (SuSy)]]

## Refining
### Mechanical R. 
Mechanical Refining refers to the processing of reducing the size of ore. 
#### Primary Crushing
Primary grinding is the initial step of crushing ores and solid sediments after they have been mined, typically resulting in grain sizes of 150-300mm (Gravel).
- Jaw
- Cone
#### Secondary Crushing
Results in grain sizes of less than a centimetre, the size of pebbles and very coarse sand.
- Gyratory
- HPGR/Roll
#### Teritary Crushing (Milling)
This stage is primarily applied before chemical treatment such as floatation and leaching. 
Averages 100-500Âµm per run (very fine sand to silt).^[Crushers, especially these mills, arrange individual machines in series to achieve the desired grain size.]
- Vertical Shaft Impactor
- Ball or Semi-Autogenous
- (For a slurry suspension:) IsaMill
## Sorting
### Sizing
These machines sort large-grained feedstock based on their size.
