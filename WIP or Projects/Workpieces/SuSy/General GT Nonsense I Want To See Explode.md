Yes, this is all highly subjective and biased. It is My Opinionâ„¢.

fix dxhitty GCYM assembler smh

## Tiers and Associated

## Circuits
## Retro-Active Improvements
## Materials
The GT5u family is badly afflicted with material orphanage, that meaning, manifolds of materials, metals and alloys having few or oftentimes only one use for something barely justified or sensical (when viewed with realism). 
IRL there's a reason for the 2500 registered and recognised steel variants, since each of them has a very specialised use, whereas GT lavishly adds new materials for the reasons of grind, gating and avoiding recipe conflicts. 
In many such cases, the requirements are exotic and commonly out of place, since a nickel or copper superalloy does not belong into the external structure of a large crusher.
The autogeneration of components from a material (ie rod, small gear, plate, etc.) adds to the bloat, since many orphan materials have completely useless autogen items.
	*I don't want to have to look through bloat and useless items which can only be recycled to find the sole usecase of a "maraging MAR762 plate".*
Gregicality Multiblocks/GT++ especially suffers from this, as each multiblock has it's own unique casing and associated alloy, who are solely used for this single thing and never again. 
	(This issue might be solved by completely axing the rather blocky and ugly GCYM multis and replacing them.)

# SuSy-Specific Gripes 
## Lack of direction on myriads of chemicals
SuSy as a pack has a ton of intermediate chemicals, and it bothers me that i have to look through 10 NEI pages to see which specific chain they're related to.
### Solution
Add a tooltip to these chemicals and components in the general format of the following:
	Derived from \[Predecessor].
	Used in \[Product]. 
	Associated to \[Final Product] and \[Initial Component] Processing.
	*Optionally:*
	Part in \[Name of Pocessing Chain].
### Example: Pig Iron
 Derived from **Iron Ores**.
 Used in **Steel, Wrought Iron**. 
 Associated to **Steel** and **Iron Ore** Processing.
 Part in **Extraction of iron metal from ore**.
