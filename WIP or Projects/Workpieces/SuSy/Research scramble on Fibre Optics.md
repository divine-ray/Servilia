Mostly due to my grunge on the far-away AE2. You want hard realism, you get hard realism. 


Glass optical Fibres are almost always made from silica
	other materials (fluorozirconate, fluoroalumiate and chalcogenide glasses. crystalline sapphire.) are used for infrared or laser tech.
## Materials
- Silica
	fibre from silica has a especially low loss/attenuation around 1.5um (near-infrared)
	Silica can be relatively easily worked, but hard to cleave and fusion splice
	SGF can be doped to raise/lower the refractive index or to specialise for fibre amps or laser applications. Both core and cladding gets doped. 
	Very common in comms, lasers and optics (sensors). Very short range however is done with plastic. 

- Fluoride glass
	Composed of fluoride compounds of various metals. 
	It is very hard to avoid crystallisation whilst processing, ie **hard to manufacture** and fragile (and susceptible to environmental attacks). 
	Fluoride fibers are used in mid-IR spectroscopy, FO sensors, thermometry and imaging. Fl. fibres can be used for guiding YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet) lasers.

- Phosphate glass/chalcogenide
