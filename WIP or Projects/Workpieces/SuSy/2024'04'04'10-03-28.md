## Generalised Excavation
### Targeted Local Outcrop Miner
Akin to what SuSy has at the present point, but possibly with tiers (motor, drill head, maybe in-situ crushing) and more costly in operation
	- A steady supply of mining fluid and lubricant have to be supplied (and maybe drill heads if using a cheap material that wears out easily)
- This shall produce *R o c k*, perpetually 
	- Rock with a mediocre content of usable ore, approximately 20-33%. 
### Large Mining Rig
Based off the base GT mining rig but available earlier on for carving out deposits at a slow, steady rate but still depleting the deposits in-world
- This one makes ready-to-use ores, but finitely. 
- Probably needs some advanced `mechanism` to justify horizontal excavation from a vertical pipe. 
### Bucket Wheel Excavator
Rather expensive, both in initial cost and upkeep. 
	(it's sheer power cost alone justifies internal combustion engines). 
	Tremendous, perhaps ranging around 17x33m footprint.  
Only works in a established open pit mine and in softer sediments or ores which have been blasted or otherwise loosened.  
Perhaps operates between a "In-World" mode and a "Imaginary" mode.
- In-World mode yields are directly tied to the deposit it is on, and the amount of blasting this deposit has undergone.
- Imaginary mode works off invisible deposits, which are horrid in quality but near-infinite in quantity, thus allowing stationary and complex facilities for extraction.

## About Ore Deposits
ore as such should still continue to exist, albeit not in the very regular and easy to exploit grid pattern of GT5 (if possible), but perhaps lean onto GT6 where ore deposits are equal to the stone they spawn in, so having a continuous and huge deposits.
if it is possible, i’d imagine having a motherlode to such a deposit where the ore quality or usable metal per arbitrary volume is extraordinarily high, through which it diminishes further out in the edge of the deposit. This as well would provide a fair amount of usable ore from the get-go, but also last a long time once it becomes viable to extract and refine the poorer quality mineral.
The above is highly generalised, and exceptions will be made, to accommodate the nature of certain minerals and ores (because it seems unreasonable to have a displaced patch of volcanogenic minerals in the middle of the ocean)

Due to the infeasability of a tectonic simulation and similar  operto ‘accurately’ place deposits, Perlin noise must suffice again.

# Regarding Benefaction and Dressing
The desired metal of an ore is typically enclosed in a crystalline structure and encased by huge volumes of, for this case, uninteresting rock, hereby called gangue (also known as deaf rock).
All rocks and minerals have naturally occurring fissures (faults) in their structure, which is exploited in mechanical refining. 
~~Most of this is transcribed from wiki please don’t yell at me~~ :frowning2:
## Mechanical Refining
Mechanical refining refers to all processes that reduce the size of ore and gangue particles and their sorting. 
The first step is typically done at the mine directly, by crushing the rock and minerals down to a size that fits onto vehicles. 
Primary crushing cover Jaw and Cone Crushers.
    - Jaw Crusher acts by repeatedly compressing the rock through an oscillating plate against a static plate. This results in size reduction from about 1m3 (1 block) to 20cm3 (new unit needed). 
- Cone crushing operates through a static reinforced cone, around which a mantle is placed. The mantle is exposed to heavy vibration, which compresses and repeatedly crushes the rock, as the grain size reduces further down the cone. (I’ll spitball 30cm3 to 1cm3).
Secondary crushing aims to reduce the grain size into a fine powder, usually for hydrorefining.
