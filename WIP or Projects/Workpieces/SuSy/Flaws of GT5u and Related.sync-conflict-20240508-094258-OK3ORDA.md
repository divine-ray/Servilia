Yes, this is all highly subjective and biased. It is My Opinionâ„¢.

## Tiers and Associated

## Circuits
The circuits serve solely as gating method and are typically thrown in as arbitrary component to make obtaining That Machine marginally harder. Their scaling is utterly ridiculous, as with the material progression as the sense of reality fades away. 
There simply is no need for four or more variations of a technology-tiered circuit. Stop it. 
Those cases where the computation is actually applicable (I.e. Research Station and related), the craziness of progression has already gone haywire and then demands Sentient Mainframe Computers or similar to analyse some piece of tech that already has been made a dozen times throughout the game, only in different flavours because "Muh, Tiers!". 
## Retro-Active Improvements
## Materials
The GT5u family is badly afflicted with material orphanage, that meaning, manifolds of materials, metals and alloys having few or oftentimes only one use for something barely justified or sensical (when viewed with realism). 
IRL there's a reason for the 2500 registered and recognised steel variants, since each of them has a very specialised use, whereas GT5u/GTCE(u) lavishly adds new materials for the reasons of grind, gating and avoiding recipe conflicts. 
In many such cases, the requirements are exotic and commonly out of place, since a nickel or copper super-alloy does not belong into the external structure of a large crusher.
The auto-generation of components from a material (ie rod, small gear, plate, etc.) adds to the bloat, since many orphan materials have completely useless autogen items.
	*I don't want to have to look through bloat and useless items which can only be recycled to find the sole use-case of a "Maraging MAR762 plate".*
Gregicality Multiblocks/GT++ especially suffers from this, as each multiblock has it's own unique casing and associated alloy, who are solely used for this single thing and never again. 
	(This issue might be solved by completely axing the rather blocky and ugly GCYM multis and replacing them.)
It suffers from the loop of the following:
- Unlock `This Tier X`
- Automate/obtain `This Tier's Materials`
- Progress
- Unlock `This Tier Y`
- Forget about `This Tier X`
# SuSy-Specific Gripes 

SuSy's multiblocks should and could make use of already present GCYM components. This refers to the electrolytic cell block for the parallelised electrolysis cell, which has shiny funky RGB effects. 
I heard someone complain that it is too expensive, costing IV-something circuits: SIMPLY ADJUST THE PRICING.
Additionally, there should be machines that enable higher throughput of processing materials and chemicals, such as a multiblock roaster. 
Technologically speaking *it is not that hard* to build a machine that really just fries/mixes feedstock (Roaster). 
## Lack of direction on myriads of chemicals
SuSy as a pack has a ton of intermediate chemicals, and it bothers me that i have to look through 10 NEI pages to see which specific chain they're related to.
### Solution
Add a tooltip to these chemicals and components in the general format of the following:
	Derived from \[Predecessor].
	Used in \[Product]. 
	Associated to \[Final Product] and \[Initial Component] Processing.
	*Optionally:*
	Part in \[Name of Pocessing Chain].
### Example: Pig Iron
 Derived from **Iron Ores**.
 Used in **Steel, Wrought Iron**. 
 Associated to **Steel** and **Iron Ore** Processing.
 Part in **Extraction of iron metal from ore**.
