[[Sir Rey]], being economic-noble, has a massive manor/residence
the architects of said manor were asked “how trope-y or stereotypical should this building be?” and the answer of Rey was: “yes.”
thus, its jam-packed of mildly confusing halleyways, wack doors and seemingly useless rooms and windows
plenty of hidden mechanisms and such as well

possibly a thingy about Rey being introduced as he’s about to enter the process of dying of old age (in the slow, peaceful way) and how his family details with this situation, and the manor and other inherited property to that
and well, given that Rey is/was involved with AuDeRey and probably other companies in Frisco, how they handle all the management of their businesses 

since I really wanna experiment with stories that are exclusively or primarily told through in-universe documents and paper things,
I could imagine that the introduction thingy is a letter from an external doctor or something (possibly because the in-house medical staff can’t help?) saying that Sir Rey is certainly going to die soon 
for the sake of story flow and consistency I’ll just entirely forego the curse of the undead/undying because guh 

for this to properly work as a story I’d have to develop his closer family and also most likely employees/manor staff :v 
- wife/partner/spouse
- child(ren)
- parents, most likely deceased already but still relevant (possibly those who actually gave rise to the family wealth)
