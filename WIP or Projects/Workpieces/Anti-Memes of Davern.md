Something about Anti-Memes/Censored Objects in [[Davern Kingdom|Davern]]
Their tremendous hoards of anomalous and magic items and stuff are occasionally forgotten/obscured by the treasurers, since some rare anti-meme inflicted item has made its way into the stash, effectively making all of them forget/unlearn the presence of it.
Some auxiliary group of watchers divided from the military/guard squad is tasked to observe the treasurers, since if the facility would be antimeme-infested, the treasurers would be unable to do their duties and possibly declare the facility and stash lost.

specialised retrieval squads are then deployed, all of which are impaired in their senses to avoid perceiving/receiving the anti-meme. 
After successful extraction and/or removal, the censored objects are stored in a dedicated location with appropriate treatment. This location is a state secret. 


Also: Their currency could be self obscuring as well, by the effect that it slowly makes one forget or trick into believing that it does not hold any value no more (as mechanism to force circulation and regulation)
