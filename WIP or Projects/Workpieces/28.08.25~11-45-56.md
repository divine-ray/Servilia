[[Iron Monasteries]] cultivate iron forming bogs, the iron of which is considered holy. the bacteria cultivars or stems have been bred and improved over the eons to produce the purest possible iron, along with several other bacteria that remove impurities. 
this is also how the monasteries got the collective name, as they usually all have a bog-garden.
