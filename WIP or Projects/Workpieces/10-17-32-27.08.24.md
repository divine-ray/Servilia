I have not heard of my [[mother]] ever since i started training for this job. Apparently, so i am guessing, she really does not approve of this. I have been meaning to visit her for a while now, but never got around to it. Truth is, that i am rather scared of such heads-on meeting. 

My [[Michell Sarrass|father]] has drowned himself in alcohol, partially in heritage of his own dad, my grandfather, partially due to how little he could see me without saying that he is heavily depending on me, both emotionally and financially. 

There are few other people that I value closely such as friends. Many of them are spread across the continent, some I haven‘t heard of in years. They might‘ve ended [[up eating lead]]. Who knows? I don‘t.
