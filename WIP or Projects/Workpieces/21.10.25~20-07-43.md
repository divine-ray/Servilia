itd be really funny if the [[Random Shit I found On Etsy]] healing crystals would be helpful for channeling and weaving twilit, but they also *really* hate you and explode or catch fire or fling shrapnel around 
I mean yeah we don’t have anything down regarding crystals yet and given the rule of natural conductivity, some super specific rare minerals could certainly act as booster
so you gotta find a balance between the natural, potent and very volatile state and refining them into more stable but less potent versions 
raw gems and gemstones irl look like yet another rock for all I care
