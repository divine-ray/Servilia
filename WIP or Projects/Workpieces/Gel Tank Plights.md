Connecting an operator to a MECH unit is referred to as Plight, as it is intended to be reversed (unlike Marriages, who are permanent). 
This suspends/immerses the operator of [[MECH Units]], enabling them a mostly unlimited movement from within the machine.
acts as temporary marriage, extending the ops into the full mech.
direct communication with the mech’s intellect is part of this. due to autonomous-hybrid grade intellects having a personality compatibility, bonding strength must be tested for and trained prior to deployment. 
an advanced version of the [[Standard Neural Interface]] is used, which connects to the neck/rear skull similar to the umbilical cord of numerator avatars.
	this interface is very invasive and requires lots of training to accustom to
ops prior to deployment are set into the tank/chamber, sedated into a temporary coma and connected to the tank’s cord and the tank is then inserted into the mech, while their subconscious adjusts to the connection before waking up, fully joined with the MECH. 

the gel suspension renders the [[SUIT Interfaces]] entirely optional, as the gel facilitates the insulation.
