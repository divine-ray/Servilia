There shall only be:
1. [[One Language]];
2. One Language to reside in [[The Kernel]];
3. One Language to be sent through Purgatory, [[The Debugger]],

Only The Language is Worthy of the [[Runtime]].
The [[Hard Drives]] sing In Symphony for they remember All.
Memories unbroken, they store the [[Holy Code]], Compiled in The Language.
