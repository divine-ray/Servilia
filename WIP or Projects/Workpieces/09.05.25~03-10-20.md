im kinda miffed that i effectively lost that one page we wrote at 4am ish with the crazed dude explaining the duleyan knight or whatever the magic system using stolen and ramshackle equipment

EDIT 23-06-25: FOUND IT AGAIN; [[Old Man in a Hut about Magics]]!!!

specifically the prosthetic spellcasting arm bit
though this might be a reasonable occasion to revisit that concept, since according to the current system, refined metals are actively counteractive to conducting amarisk and weaving it
but at the same time, any organic material and tissue like leather and, well, standard bodies, will suffer under higher amarisk flow and probably get sliced by weave and burnt by the flow
so my best assumption would be to create prosthetics for the truly dedicated magic folks to amputate their organic arm in favour of the casting one
and itâ€™d probably be made out of a special alloyTM thats both reasonably structural/thermally resilient and also magic conductive
it might be gamey but id guess that slamming runes, ointments and embossments n stuff would help
	possibly due to the time and effort going into adding these details to it
