Writing exercise and general project:
Newspapers for the cities of the confederation or one council-endorsed propaganda print for thylyist
# Frisco Bay Confederation
## [[Duley and Port]]
Duley Weekly Scientist would be emphasised on studies and projects conducted by the universities of Duley, accompanied with gossiping and speculating about both science things and the people behind it
## [[Frisco]]
frisco being the capital, would presumably be centered around politics and yellow press of the nobility/public figures. likely also relevant to the low threshold military agenda against thylyist
## [[Brisburne]]
 brisbourne is exclusively about economics and trade bickering. thats it.  maybe has an irregular special release exclusively with smut and other lewd media for the travelling folks.
