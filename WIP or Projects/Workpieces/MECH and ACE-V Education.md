[[MECH Units]] and [[ACE-V]] units matching a >80% autonomy and intellect cannot be created battle-ready but instead have to be raised and taught in a ‘evil’ kindergarten where they learn to fight and kill. 
Their complexity and autonomy is simply too high to be written via BCI during assembly/geniture. 
These facilities are typically highly secured to avoid destruction from a childish MECH throwing a fit. 
Lobotomites or near-vegetative organisms are often used as training dummies to accustom the combat units to their purpose.
