You, yes, you. I know you're reading this, and I have something to tell you.
Anything that you read here is not truly supposed to sell you a story or imagery of some hallucinated place, but emotions. There's nothing I understand in this deranged world but myself, or that's what I believe. 
If you came here for some franchise worthy canon full of quirky and likeable characters, you're at the wrong door. This world... It's just like yours. You're trying to escape from your misery, and so are we. But ours is built different, so sit down and share. 
So delectable, undeniable styles undetectable.

Please, we're desparate for feedback or input. Anything but no reaction means so much to us.
