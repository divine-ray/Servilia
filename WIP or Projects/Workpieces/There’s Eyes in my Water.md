It touches my lips,
Its gaze cuts my throat from the inside.
From the dark into the light i saw a delight that never dies - 
The birth of a storm hidden within these eyes - and now within my body.
I swallowed that what once saw and once gifted light to another being. 
	Now I am the heretic, the violator of corpses. 
	How must I pledge myself guilty in front of an apparition we all believe in?
	The judges who donâ€™t exist, those who we call Morale?
	
Now hastily, swallow the glass, to blind the seers inside. 
No, this is safe, yes, this is suicide. 
Haste now! They will see inside you, see yourself and your life in all its wrongdoings!
It is too late, they know now. Be wary, someone but you knows your guilts and memories now.

`TEAR THEM OUT`
`YOUR FLESH HAS BETRAYED YOU`
`YOU WILL NEVER SEE TRUE AGAIN`
