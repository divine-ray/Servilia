[[Iron Monasteries]] cultivate iron forming bogs, the iron of which is considered blessed.  
The bacteria cultivars have been bred and improved over all their years in seclusion to produce the purest possible iron at a rate not measured in human livespans, along with several other bacteria cultures that remove impurities.  
This is also how the monasteries got the collective name, as they usually all have a bog-garden which cultivates these bogs.  
Even if the iron production there is at a glacial pace, it still grants them a slight amount of material freedom and independence from having to engage in trade with other factions.  
Together with [[charcoal from nemi]],  blest iron-based steel alloys form the basis for the majority of craftsmanship and iconography %% #TODO: what is it called to make religious icons, relics and items?%% from and of the [[Old Mekhane Faith]]. 
The special nature of these relics natively attracts some attention of spirits and energies alike.
