A mythical substance frequently used by the [[Universal Pantheon]] and other [[Divinity]]. Said to enable/cause their elemental powers and drive their ability to create. 

Ordinary humans who consume godsweed are said to gain demigodly powers and twilit attunement, but burn out in a span of less than a week, first mentally through psychosis and then bodily, through intense burns and scarring. 

Very few incident of this substance getting into the hands of humans are known, a couple of which are attributed to [[The Zubin Society]], although this is fabled. 
The [[Nølkā]] cite that the [[First Nolkan]] was only able to establish contact with [[Yaldabaoth]] and found their religion and following through the extraordinary powers granted by godsweed.
Their rapid succumbing to psychosis and perishing is revered as martyrdom among the nolka.
