> I live in a low income housing environment that goes by the government name of "Section 8." Me and a group of my allies control certain areas of this section in order to run our illegitimate business. We possess unregistered firearms, stolen vehicles, mind-altering inhibitors and only use cash for financial purchases. If anyone would like to settle unfinished altercations, I will be more than happy to release my address. I would like to warn you; I am a very dangerous person and I regularly disobey the law.


[[13.08.25~21-44-45 (crime groupings)]] - [[Section 8]], possibly the most dangerous/influential organisation in [[Amida-8]] and among the top gangs of all Amida.

the way the copypasta is phrased makes me think of an android or NHP due to its very unemotional tone. 
hoh: NHP/synthetics crime gang?
well, with the balatro there’s grounds to believe that a very limited group of synth/NHP/MECHs lost/broke their restrictions and throttling to become truly independent outside of an imposed directive, and turned to the “illegal” underground.
said underground might as well just be society and life outside of the bloody reign of the corpos and stuff
