writing system of the [[Varu√∫]] is a phonetic transcription of their spoken language engraved onto alloy sheets using a mixture of acid and saliva (which is corrosive enough to stain this metal)

the language itself is closely related to ancient mesopotamia, featuring many vowels and accents and combinations^[pre- and suffixes], few sharp sounds. punctuation is nearly absent, and a new sentence is indicated through newlines.
