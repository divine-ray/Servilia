something about mecha, rambling time
## Intelligence Classifications
The Intelligence piloting a mobile combat unit is classified under three categories:
1. Autonomous
	 Fully independent cognition, capable of reasoning and own actions. 
 2. Restricted
	 Limited cognition, able to execute complex tasks but not capable of improvising.
 3. Hybrid
	 A subclass of 1. Autonomous,  these systems are oriented around providing assistance to a humanoid pilot, but can steer the unit with little flexibility on its own.
4. Blind, Deaf, Dumb (BDD)
	 Barely considered intelligent, these units fully require a pilot to function.  
## Types and Roles
mechs (mobile entity combat hybrids) fill these roles:
- oversized exoskeleton, piloted by soldiers
- main battle tank equivalent on six/eight legs, autonomous entity with rationale intellect
- scout unit using digitigrade bipedal stride, barely armoured but extremely agile, hybrid piloting (soldiers + AI)
- Troop Transport and APC in a quadruped frame, steered by a autonomous intelligence

different branch for aerial combat, [[Aerial Combat Entity/Vehicle]] (ACE/V), respectively if they're piloted or autonomous.
Those are used for:
- Cargo and troop transport (Carriers)
- Reconnaissance and Intel
- Bombing
Dog-fighting and air-to-air combat with these units is rare, due to lacking agility and speed.
