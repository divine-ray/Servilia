Davern acts as the anomalous item and entity collection and study nation (not to call it SCP Foundation/Lobotomy Corporation).
for reference, they (their philosophers and by extend the general non-nolkan people) don’t know anything about the processes and workings of magics since studies and experimenting only has begun under the [[New King]]’s ministries. 
Their society and systematics are hardly rigid, but common categories span:
- Living
	- Human
		- [[Nølkā]] (following the collapse of their theocracy)
		- Twilit/sorcerer (those involved in twilit magicks)
	- Animal (of little concern)
	- Beast (threats)
- Object
	- Weapon
	- Contraption (anything remotely complex/mechanical)
- Building
	- Thing (object of study, fallback designation)
