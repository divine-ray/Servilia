A lone, abandoned cabin in the woods, seemingly left abandoned. The previous dwellers apparently did not care for taking their belongings with them, as most furniture is left intact and where it should be. Aside from a fair layer of dust, mould and creeping plants, the cabin seems mostly okay, but you don’t trust the integrity of the likely rotting wood. 
The fireplace seems to be free of the encroaching plant-life however, as if it has been recently used. The char markings and ash support this assumption. 
Something you haven’t felt noteworthy of remarking is that it has an expansion that connects it flush to the nearby slope in elevation. At least you believe it is an expansion, as the craftsmanship of the wood beams used are mounted with a notably poor quality compared to the rest of the cabin. 
Further in the cabin, in the back of the expansion, sits a wrought steel door. 
A small slide-open porthole allows you to gaze into a darkness unidentifiable. 
This door, solid enough to withstand a battering ram, was poorly barricaded with a few wood planks. This confused you. Why would anyone bar up a door of this strength? What were they hiding? What looms here, causing them to-
Now you realise. The former dwellers were scared. But scared of what, or who?
Wait. 
Listen.
You press your ear against the tiny opening in the door. 
Somewhere in that darkness you hear a *thud!.* And again. *thud!* Like something solid.. hitting something solid…
Your thoughts lock up for a moment as your brain tries to decide between fear and curiosity. 
In a whim, you decide.
You scavenge the cabin for a tool to remove the boards. You need to know. 
There. This hammer must do. The formers must have left it. 
With some labour and effort the boards are gone, splintered. 
There is no light behind the door. Another *thud!* echoes, this time clearly audible. 
In an attempt to find a light source you only find a single, dimly glowing crystal shard. It is heavy and cold like a fair steel bar. The sharp edges make it hard to carry around. 
Wrapped it in parts of your cloth. There, bearable. 
This is an awful light source. But it is one. 
*thud! thud! thud!* 
You struggle, but pull the heavy metal door open.
Water drips from the raw, untreated rock walls. Your breath condensates into puffs of vapour.
It is freezing cold. You shiver, realising that you are woefully  underdressed. 
*thud! thud! THUD!*
