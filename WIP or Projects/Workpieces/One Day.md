One Day. One Day those who you have left behind, scarred and scared, will come for you. 
They will take back what you scoundrel took of them.  
The demands you impose are taxing, ridiculous and insane. It is nothing that will be left alone or to rot, it is a burning memory.   
Always present in the back of their mind, your actions strike [[Division Bell|forlorn bells]] in dissonance.   
The trail of mutilated, broken corpses and dying men and women alike paints a scarlet stain on your perfect masquerade.
