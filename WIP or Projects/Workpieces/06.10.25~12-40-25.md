[[Frisco Economy]]
maybe they achieve UBI enabling a fair wealth in the [[Tomorrow]] timeline. but that would make a lot of the very simple and crude jobs fall away, since people who only do brain dead jobs would instantly quit. 
So, because we’re not in our IRL capitalism hellscape where you can throw money at every problem to make it go away, I would guess that there is a lottery or other random selector for shuffling people around to fill these vacant jobs (and also to force people to gather new experiences), but qualifications are still checked
