[[Frisco Economy]]
maybe they achieve UBI enabling a fair wealth in the Tomorrow timeline. but that would make a lot of the very simple and crude jobs fall away, since people who only do brain dead jobs would instantly quit. 
So, because weâ€™re not in our IRL capitalism hellscape where you can throw money at every problem to make it go away, I would guess that there is a lottery or other random selector for shuffling people around to fill these vacant jobs (and also to force people to gather new experiences), but qualifications are still checked
