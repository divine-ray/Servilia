the thylyist overhead rail system certainly is one of the contraptions ever 

wondering wether or not they have semi automated assembly machines for devices, like an alcove full of doodads that can reconfigure an universal tool system to do anything

I am *really* uncertain if the mekhanites have complex automatons capable of actual tasks and labour (as opposed to being novelties and showpieces)
