I am quite intrigued by the concept of some sort of intellect or other consciousness that simply does not align with human cognition, may it be the [[Cluster]] or some lavish creation that stands somewhere between wetware computer, silicon computing and using weave for that grain of sentience.
alternatively, silicon-borne intellects which can interact with humans but are very eerie and alien (to humans) in their reasoning and behaviour, maybe part due to them being just *so* much faster and with greater capacity without the burdens of emotions and other organic woes

and naturally, there ought to be some type of cult or secret society/division revolving around that ~~doodad~~ intellect or consciousness

such a system would be dubbed Elysium or otherwise mention that, as reference to the video game and to honour the [[Afterlives]] and the link to the directly tied-in [[Twilit]] [[weave]].  

the concept of bicameral minds from LANCER is very interesting, as that kinda leads onto [[Subpersonas]] or alternatively turning your computation centre/conscious into an entire DID system with each personality/alter fulfilling one argument position and approach to reason. 
though tbf we have not developed or spec'd out the details of how numerator cognition is organised, but there's a very harsh difference between numerators with an organic host and those without one, i.e. entirely self-formed on silicon and neurons
