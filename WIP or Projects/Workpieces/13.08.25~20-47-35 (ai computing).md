i am quite intrigued by the concept of some sort of intellect or other consciousness that simply does not align with human cognition, may it be the [[Cluster]] or some lavish creation that stands somewhere between wetware computer, silicon computing and using weave for that grain of sentience.
and naturally, there ought to be some type of cult or secret society/division centered around that doodad 

such a system would be dubbed Elysium or otherwise mention that, as reference to the video game and to honour the [[Afterlives]] and the link to the directly tied-in [[Twilit]] weave.  
the concept of bicameral minds from LANCER is also very interesting, as that kinda leads onto [[Subpersonas]] or alternatively turning your computation centre into an entire DID system with each personality/alter fulfilling one argument position and approach to reason. 
though tbf we have not developed or spec'd out the details of how numerator cognition is organised, but there's a very harsh difference between numerators with an organic host and those without one, i.e. entirely self-formed on silicon and neurons
