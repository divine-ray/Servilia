# AKA Other General GT Nonsense I Want To See Explode
Yes, this is all highly subjective and biased. It is My Opinionâ„¢.

# SuSy-Specific Gripes 
## Lack of direction on myriads of chemicals
SuSy as a pack has a ton of intermediate chemicals, and it bothers me that i have to look through 10 NEI pages to see which specific chain they're related to.
### Solution
Add a tooltip to these chemicals and components in the general format of the following:
	Derived from \[Predecessor].
	Used in \[Product]. 
	Associated to \[Final Product] and \[Initial Component] Processing.
	*Optionally:*
	Part in \[Name of Pocessing Chain].
### Example: Pig Iron
 Derived from **Iron Ores**.
 Used in **Steel, Wrought Iron**. 
 Associated to **Steel** and **Iron Ore** Processing.
 Part in **Extraction of iron metal from ore**.
