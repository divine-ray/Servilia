preliminary and loose collection of creatures present in the various depths of the [[Astral Ocean]]. 

ridiculously long strands of kelp or something that attaches to floating rock islands, capable of reacting to basic stimuli (I.e. wrapping things up or so)

wood-like rigid plant growths that affix to rock, bones and other debris to create weird structures

some plant that extends downwards from any larger islands or solid masses in an illusion to touch the ground
-> creates verticality for things to grow on
alternatively, some extremely fast growing (1 meter per week) corals that *grow* islands

underwater “birds”, ie some critters that use proportionally huge wings for propulsion

a parasite that carves out its host, leaving nothing but the skin and bone as husk, enabling it to disguise itself
evil fucked up hermit crab that takes shelter in shipwrecks and floating around with them 

luminescent zooplankton that creates light patterns akin to those that appear in the visions of magic users ([[sacred geometry]]),
gets really pissed and angry if these patterns are disturbed 

siphonophore in kilometre long colonies passively producing a ridiculous current and voltage as defense (its just an exposed under seas cable)

phytoplankton swarms that grow on the remains of human remains sinking, eventually covering the entire carcass and potentially mimicking its original appearance and even moving it

reefbacks (for uniqueness sake, isletbacks) from subnautica, whales that are in a pseudo parasitic relationship with ↓, however whales are strong enough to maintain the added weight and thus can indefinitely sustain the reef on their backs 

a parasitoid or otherwise harmful coral polyp that settles on living beings, anchoring in their flesh (taking energy in the process) and grows carbonate skeletons on its host 
most beings succumb to the additional weight, struggling to maintain their altitude and eventually get dragged into the depths
