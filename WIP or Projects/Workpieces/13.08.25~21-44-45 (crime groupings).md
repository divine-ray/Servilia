okay, time to come up with some groupings for amida;
there ought to be a few mercenary groups, enough for them to clash and conflict

idea: [[Black Parade]] reformed into an organisation only known as [[Troupe]], 

oh don't forget about [[The Balatro]] 

pilots and operators are obv selfish and elitists who would never allow themselves to be muddled among the inferior "foot soldier" mercenaries, and thus demand differentiation (possibly to the point of sending *Visits* to people and organisations that refuse them their honour -> self-declared nobility stance)
note the distinguishing between pilot and operator - pilots is the designation for humans in non-plight units and operators for plight-based units.
