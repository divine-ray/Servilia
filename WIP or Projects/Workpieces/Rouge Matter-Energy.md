Some SCP-like digital [[anomaly]] that makes screens act as portals/ME terminal, likely out there killing and tricking people for thrills.
This portal ability is driven by experimental technology in it's parent Numerator, which allow both to interact and draw from the twilit, causing localised spatial anomalies and tunneling. 

Or rouge, autonomous fragments that cannot reason and are driven by simulated dopamine kicks. 
	Raw, primal in nature, killing for nothing but adrenaline as it lacks a body to sustain and feed.

Likely originated/birthed from a [[Memory Arrays]] fracture of a [[Numerator]] through assault of physical and psychical (digital) means.
