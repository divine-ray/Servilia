[[Project Silverspoon]] - 
the true machinists will be moved to [[Duley and Port]] and open their studies and the secrets of mekhanite engineering to the [[Universities and Faculties of Duley]], accelerating the Duleyan development of [[Forced Marriage]] and eventually create the first large-scale biocomputers, which will be the grand-grand-grandparents to [[Numerator|Numerators]].

[[Project Silverspoon]]s objective here is to agitate the [[True Machinists]] to engage with Duleyan scientists and engineers.
