He’s a government-employed inspector and safety officer assigned to [[Frisco Universal Oil]]. 
Succumbed to heavy alcohol consumption from the stress he endures, alongside how terrible of a person [[Rodrick “John Oil” DeVries]] is.
He feels rather pointless in his profession since Universal Oil happily ignores any and all safety and regulations in favour of !! PROFIT !!. It does not help his situation that [[Frisco]] administration and enforcement is extremely sluggish, probably a cover-up for corruption. 

His [[10-17-32-27.08.24|family]] is facing poverty and financial shortcoming, as he is paid on a per-case basis. Of there are none to report.
