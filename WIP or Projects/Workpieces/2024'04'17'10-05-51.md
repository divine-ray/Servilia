Once, there was a maiden...
	Who cared for the sacred stone.
		She cleaned it, and polished it,
			And though she could not read
				Its words came unbidden to her lips.

The priest was afraid.
	He took the words from her lips.
		He cast the sacred thing upon the stones.
			The maiden stood upon the cliff:
				"The waters of the seas were salt," she says.
