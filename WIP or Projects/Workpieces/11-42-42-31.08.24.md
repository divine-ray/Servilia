[[Duley and Port]] is just a giant skit as a city, where nobody obeys traffic laws and such. Transfer is chaotic, whimsy and breakneck. 
Residents have established [[Roof Routes]] of reinforced shingles and plating, which are traversed with special footwear (like cartoon spring boots but better).
Just jumping on passing carriages and vehicles is common, but technically illegal. However, the security enforcement is chronically underfunded and thus it goes by without complaints. 
This trend and behaviour has been so rampant recently that the upcoming generation of [[Duley Tunnel Rail]] carriages are made to allow operation without halting through hopping. Their roofing will also be sufficiently flat or be cladded. 

This all causes a rampant injury and mortality rate in commutes, which piledrives medical research and has gotten companies to be very lax about their working hour policies.
