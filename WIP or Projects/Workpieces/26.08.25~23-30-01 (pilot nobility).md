pilots and operators are obv selfish and elitists who would never allow themselves to be muddled among the inferior "foot soldier" mercenaries, and thus demand differentiation (possibly to the point of sending *Visits* to people and organisations that refuse them their honour -> self-declared nobility class)
note the distinguishing between pilot and operator - pilots is the designation for humans in non-plight units and operators for plight-based units. 

this “DIY Nobility” has resulted in two rough categories;
those that are akin to dynasties, in a sense that they maintain their own ranks within closed ‘families’ and such,
and those that get recognised as ‘noble’ through sheer combat and battle prowess 

all of the above only applies to the non-corporate folks, the corporate pilots are, from the pov of the nobility, no better than the average corpo paper pusher
or rather, possibly worse than the average corporateer, as they ride their beloved machines against their cause
