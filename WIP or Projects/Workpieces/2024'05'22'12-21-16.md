Wretched creature banished to the seas, vomiting gallstones who only tell lies, yet bring grand impact to those who believe these lies. 
One of these lies, unbeknownst to the priest that these are many, are the [[Lies of Iolithae Septimian]]. 
The girl knows what she is holding, she has seen the chaos-mother in her dreams, in the shadows that the temple emphasises with it’s dramatic architecture and play of light and shadow. The chaos-mother speaks to her in lies, but she cannot be deceived and sees the warped truth within. 
The girl is not unique to herself - but to the other clerics and templefolk. Those who believe in their own fabricated lives, subsequently lies, can’t accept any truth delivered as lie.
