[[Celestial Sea and Ocean Theory]] - 
the [[Astral Ocean]] we have on Servilia is kind of a transition zone (analogous to a shore) to the celestial sea, which is also why the concept of [[Spelljammers]] works and why regular sailing ships can’t traverse far out of the ocean
*also* a good reason why the planet isn’t logically round *and* why there are no other continents
