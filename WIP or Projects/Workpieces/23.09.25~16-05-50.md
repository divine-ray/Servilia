this may be silly/stupid but 
"every Long Time, a ghost or similar apparition manifests and haunts someone, getting progressively closer over the span of a week or month, and will kill you dead. the only way to not get killed is to make someone else drink or eat the same piece of stuff you had and it'll then go after that person"
the joke here is that you have to make a decision of sacrificing yourself to end this instance or to hand over the problem to someone else (trolley problem))
