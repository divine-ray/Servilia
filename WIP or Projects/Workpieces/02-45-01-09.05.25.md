The wind howls through the poorly barricaded hovel as it tries to stand on shaky stilts, driven into the mud and silt below the tides. 
Waves of the coming tide are rising to bash and bang against the rotting wood.
The wood is mangrove. It is not obvious, but the trees around this hovel recognise their former friends, their corpses skinned, cut and arranged into the will of man. 
The forest does not forget the intruders nor what they claimed and took. 


The residents of the swamp can not act. 
It would break their bond, and vow. 
The residents of the waters are able of retaliation.
It is a question of honour and dignity. 
The dwellers of the woods could easily ally with the wide waters. 
Yet they chose to remain isolated.
In its light alone they will find peace and serenity.
