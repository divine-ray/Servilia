Iceworms in the [[Northern Reaches]] that carve massive tunnels ((WORMWAYS)) through the glaciers and ice as they travel. 
Their evolution or origin might be influenced by pseudoneo arcaengineering, as their jaws or frontal segments are capable of producing extreme heat to melt/soften the ice whilst being metallicized.
These tunnelways are of great value to the inhabitants of the northern reaches as they provide shelter and ways to travel. Though, these tunnels are not forever, as the [[Eternal Glacier]] does eventually fart and close them.
