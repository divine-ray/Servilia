hrm
I should come up with a very intense story about ye olde love, trust, toxicity and abuse

a possible format that I could imagine are posts on whatever social media/comm apps amida got goin
hrm, possibly two “undergrounders”, both queered up and one of them transitions mtf along the story and the other one ends up in a failed suicide attempt which damages their body beyond repair (i.e. medical possibilities of unders) so they’re more-or-less coerced to be transferred into ⬇️
come to mention it, I would assume that theres some lower scale orange-s for medical cases where the body is utterly broken and dysfunctional but the mind, psyche and conscious are still together and willing to exist 

this feels mildly tangential to [[Time-Assisted Homicide]]

let’s call the mtf critter U.B. and the second 44
with genetic editing etc. one of the major points/arc points should be the sequence of U.B. undergoing transfer into their desired body (cloned from themselves)

both of them are among the younger demographic, 22-24 terran equivalent years

employment in amida is a fuzzy thing for the unders, yet I imagine that 44 is interested in WRS

as average unders they’re not aware of crawlers (as they should be)
