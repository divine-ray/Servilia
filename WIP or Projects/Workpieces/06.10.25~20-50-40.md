plot idea/expansion: test driver of the first blink/weave capable mech suffers great injury with their substance being entangled with the weave, causing them to be really unstable in spacetime to stabilise them, their body is placed into a MORASS (imagine a hardsuit sized intensive care unit) they really do not want to live anymore, knowing that they should be dead but keep jumping/skipping in spacetime before all attempts to end themselves so this leads to this individual experiencing an awful lot of time travel shenanigans in an endeavour of death
    in all of this, their lover or partner or so has to face these truths instead of trying to convince them to go on
