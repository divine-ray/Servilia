“Here, listen. You came to me for guidance and my opinion”, said the elderly man, barely holding his posture on a tremor-shaken cane. 
I took my time, waited for him to collect his thoughts and to speak again.
“You. er, mmmm-“ he said, trailing off into thoughts. Or maybe he noticed a logical fallacy.
He tried again: Well, if you want to do your thing, uh, what was this thing again?”.
	And he lost his train of thought again.
Bothered by his own ineptitude and inability to talk to me, he gave up, any further attempt to talk to him drowned out by huge gears close by, who only now set into motion and rapidly accelerating into a deafening whirr. 
Disappointed, the old man walked away, or at least tried to. 

Unsatisfied and slightly disgruntled, I made way and went down the alleyway, trying to ignore the noise stemming from the mechanical parts above me.  There was nothing interesting either here, spare for the filth. It’s probably been a long time since it’s been cleaned up here. I can even see little puddles of ooze consisting of lubricant and metal sheddings, probably dripped down from that apparatus above. 
Moving onwards, I was struck with these thoughts:
		“How do people enjoy their lives here?”
	“It’s all so sterile, and lacklustre. There’s nothing i could possibly do for myself nor about the situation here.”
		“Everything is crumbling, decaying, and apparently nobody cares about it.”
Not shortly after, the rough and uneven cobble alleyway opened up to a properly tiled and very busy road, on which all kinds of people went their ways. Something that I haven’t seen here before are long metal bars, held midair by apparently solid stone. 
Mildly overwhelmed by the noise of all the traffic and continued presence of the axles turning overhead I tried to regain orientation, or at least figure out where to go next. 
But then, a foreign noise caught my attention, a rapidly-approaching metallic resonance, which stemmed from the suspended bars. It was moments after that a vehicle slid down these bars, whom I now realise to be rails, at a jarring speed which made me worry for their safety. 
Though, it seemed like the people around didn't care a bit, mind the shrieking, which almost sent me cowering. Not used to this, stepping back. 
I was left out, standing there lacking direction, among what best resembles a busy anthill; everyone and everything knowing where to go in a relentless chaotic stream of people and goods.
