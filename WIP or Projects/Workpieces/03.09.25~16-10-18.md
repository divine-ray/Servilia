[[THE WHITE WOODS]] - witches; the witches in the white woods are vaguely deformed deer/moose with their antlers positioned around their maws, like mandibles of insects. 
their hind legs are eerily mirrored, appearing to stride backwards, away from the rest of the body. 
Some of them use a gait akin to humanoid apes, with chitinous, leathery fists instead of hooves.
