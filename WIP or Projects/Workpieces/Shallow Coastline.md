Archeological surveys during general construction and exploration have revealed remnants of artificial excavation and structures reinforcing deep channels, which would’ve allowed large vessels to dock on inland ports. 
Currently, we do not know nor have any machinery or equipment capable of excavating underwater. 
While we would be able to dry out the entire [[Frisco Bay]], it’d be an undertaking of the century and would cut us off of our trades and business, and therefore is out of question.
