[[adAstra SocInstitute]] had developed self-contained technologies to manipulate the genes of any carbon-based organism without giving birth to a sucessor who will express these traits. 
Unfortunately, this knowledge was target of a freak hacker attack of [[Network 24); DROP TABLE]], who suceeded in leaking this technology to the public. This led to a rampant proliferation known as the [[Gene Crash]], which gave rise and birth to many many humanoid subspecies (furries, mothpeople, etc).
