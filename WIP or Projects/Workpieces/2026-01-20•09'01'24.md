[[Tomorrow]]s city architecture dictates a small-ish line of grass and other lower plants growing atop of a drainage system on the edges of each street with accompanying inclination.
This is used in urban areas to replace sewage drains, also to ease decomposition of organic wastes.

This "Green Strip" is widened in some places, enough to provide supplementary gardening to the local residents.
