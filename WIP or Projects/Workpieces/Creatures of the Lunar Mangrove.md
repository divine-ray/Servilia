also a critter idea for [[Lunar Mangroves]];
rainworld like poleworm consisting of a mega colony (maybe jellyfish like?) of bacteria or other simple life mimicking a mangrove sapling or random stick

suspiciously tree-shaped millipede, probably filter-feeder if not symbiont with a bunch of real plants growing atop of it. obviously nocturnal
might also be oddly shaped to have it collect biomass, soil and other stuff on its back for allowing otherwise foreign plants to grow on it, supporting the tree vibe.
presumably very lethargic or slow as its diet is hardly sufficient, but allows them to get stupidly old (turtle life)
prefers to stay in the central areas of the area (LOOC: because I think it’d be obvious if a deplaced bunch of trees and shrubbery stood in front of you)

slightly tripod fish looking whale shark that filter-feeds exclusively the surface

some weird mole-beaver cross that actively constructs dams and networks in the roots

# plant time!!

some sort of sideways strangling fig that acts to build bridges across the bigger waterways and instead suspend their roots down from the ‘bridge arc’

a fucked up parasite that alters the shape and growth of the mangrove roots, straightening them and forcing the host tree to grow faster and straight-up, eventually causing it to crash and fall over
