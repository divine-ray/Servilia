king earl the yellow was originally a mekhanite, whose territory got split off and became autonomous during the conflicts against the dragons 
which also led to one dragon beconing prisoner of war forever  in the catacombs

his successor, [[New King]], king grey the blue, fucking loves tea
loves tea so much that he started expedition efforts to find new ones
but also it's a secret (need to know basis for his advisors and the ministry) to give the general population a mild antimeme resistance and boost their twilit affinity
something about the nølka too 


the main bit to their history that I have connected now is

the kingdom was originally a part of thylyist empire, which got shattered and decimated in several wars
so the now-king is mekhanite in belief and conviction and managed to secure a dragon as prisoner of war 
but over time their belief in mekhane and the fellowship waned, as the mekhanites continued warring and killing despite loosing almost everything 
stuff happens, time passes, the kingdom grows to a decent size
the last conflict between the mekhanites and nølkā happens, which enacts a genocide on the nølkā, leaving the survivors as diaspora. a good handful of which become refugees to Davern, and attain court flesh-bender ranks and protection
the king eventually suffers from old age and declining mental capacity, so he calls upon his court nølkā to siphon the life force of the comatose dragon pow
