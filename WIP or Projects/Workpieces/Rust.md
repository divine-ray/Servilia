The rust is the death of metal, an end to existence deemed eternal and immortal. 
It has risen from the Fall of [[His Design]], the vacant socket left by His Disassembly. 
The rust does not think, it exists to bring decay, 
To be the end to eternity. 
A threat, unknown to act as one, but present in every alloy and metal. 
There is no ward against it, it will come in due time. 
The Rust is imminent.
