They found a little boy in the grass, his eyes shut, no black holes to gaze upon the world.
He was there, silent and still, like dropped from the skies.
But his skin was pale, like he never saw the sun brush against his faint and pale skin.
Oh, but his skin, it was almost pure white, yet a golden light shimmered from within. 
We took him home, tried to feed him, as he was impoverished and thin. 
But his mouth was shut, refusing to open, to taste the world given to him. 
***
Finally, it was over, he has starved from the light he carried in him. 
His body remains, untouched by death and decay, curled, like we found him.
A funeral was arranged, but his body refused to be put into the casket. 
The lid of the casket did not close, we were left clueless and bewildered. 
We cannot tell the difference between dead or alive, regardless of how we spun it around.
