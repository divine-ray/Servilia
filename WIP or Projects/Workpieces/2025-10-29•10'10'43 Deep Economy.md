consider: the deep state but instead its the deep economy ran by a covert organisation (totally not MC&D btw) including [[Mr. Business]] and [[Mr. Worldwide]]

but the meta goal is to avoid the same old ass scenario where 1% of the population has 95% of all wealth in the broad daylight
given how aggressive the [[Finance and Economic Overwatch Agency|FEOA]] can be, I think this could lead to some pretty interesting Noir Detective things, especially in [[Brisburne]]
