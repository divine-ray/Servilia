Monoatomic Andara crystals with 'male' and 'female' divine energy vibration.

These two crystals were formed millions of years ago in an area of volcanic activity, which is now referred to as the `Sierra Nevada`, the volcano Mount Shasta is called, depending on geologists either included or referred to as a sub-area.  
The area where it was formed can only be roughly defined as the `Sierra Nevada`/Mount Shasta since the occurrence of plate tectonics, volcanism and erosion over the last million years has moved the crystals around. 
They were both found in a mine in Northern California in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  
This area is also called “Lady Nellie’s Land” because Lady Nellie, an Indian Medicine woman of the Choctaw/Chanta tribe, who is closely associated with the discovery of Andara crystals.
Monoatomic crystals consist of silicon oxide and the so-called Prima Matra, which is also called  
Prime matter or etherium.
The Prima Matra consists of 70-90 monoatomic minerals, it is, as the name suggests, the  
first form of gross material that emerged as part of the formation of planet Earth  
has formed.  
This mystical and legendary substance has very high energetic properties  
awarded, such as support for completely healthy being, cell rejuvenation and  
Expansion of consciousness.  
There are different monoatomic crystals in different qualities and different  
chemical compositions worldwide.  
The crystals with the highest Etherium concentration come from Sierra Nevada, among others  
they are also among the oldest in the world. The bigger the crystal, the bigger it is  
Etherium content, the higher the etherium content in the crystals, the more powerful they are  
Vibration.  
Under the influence of pressure and heat, the Prima Matra was transformed into crystals.  
Depending on what the composition of the Prima Matra was, as well as the process of heating,  
The cooling, as well as the pressure conditions, created crystals in different colors and shapes  
and structures.  
The crystals vibrate in a so-called 5-dimensional vibration field, which is also called  
Vibration of Divine Perfection is referred to.  
This vibration is so strong that it begins to transform everything around it  
swings lower.  
  
The two specimens you can see in the photos are ancient crystals with an immense  
high Prima Matra concentration, they are full of Etherium, accordingly it is recommended  
deal with them carefully and consciously.  
The blue-black crystal weighs 5.4kg, the green-black 8kg.  
The value of these crystals is infinite, they were found in a sacred place with a temple atmosphere  
specially designed for expanding consciousness.  
The crystals have been involved in over 500 healing sessions and consciousness expansion sessions and  
were thereby additionally activated and charged.  
They radiate such strong energy that they affect their entire surroundings within a large radius  
harmonize and positively influence.  
They support the ego to be completely transformed and consciously transformed into a divine being  
state to occur.  
This process can be very beautiful and pleasant, but it can also be very demanding  
and intense.  
These crystals are powerful power objects, divine consciousnesses, as well as infinite,  
hyperintelligent fields of consciousness that work individually for the benefit of all.  
If 10 different people enter a room containing the crystals, it can  
be that they have a different effect on everyone, they are tailor-made, everyone gets exactly what they want  
is useful in the here and now and what corresponds to his free will.  
The two crystals are like infinite books, they carry the knowledge and wisdom of  
male and female expression of the absolute, the love within itself, which only exists in that  
Looking at the stones through which vibration is transmitted. They give to the viewer  
Awareness of exactly what is desired in the here and now with free will  
to expand optimally.  
Looking at, touching or holding these Andaras, even during meditation, can be a...  
cause immense expansion of consciousness, so that the cells and the DNA of those with them  
works, can be structured according to the Divine Order.  
They carry deep cosmic knowledge and wisdom and teach conscious dealings with them  
creative powers.  
It is important that there is the will to expand consciousness, if this is the case  
the crystals have an unrestricted effect.  
Love is the key to developing the full spectrum of effects.  
If you are interested in purchasing, be aware that the vibration is like this  
What is powerful and transformative is that it can be very life changing, in all areas.  
The crystals harmonize and increase the vibration of the room and the house  
Vibration frequency, so that a balanced, holy temple atmosphere is created. This has  
  
a positive impact on sleep, on conversations, meditation, yoga, art, on everything they do  
want to do from the heart.  
They not only reflect light, but absorb it, combining the absorbed light with theirs  
natural vibration and then radiate it into yours in a modified and potentiated vibration  
environment.  
The crystals can serve as a mirror to help you reflect all of this  
and to put aside what does not correspond to your true being, as well as yourself in your divine  
to consciously recognize truth.  
No liability is assumed for transformation processes that occur in connection with the  
crystals, purchasing and working with them is entirely on your own  
Responsibility.  
It is our wish that the crystals are in an environment where they are honored and loved  
they work for the benefit of all.
