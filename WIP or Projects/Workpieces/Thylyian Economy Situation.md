Despite all the fuss about religious worship and Machine Divinity present in [[Empire of Thylyist|Thylyist]], their economy is still surprisingly marxist, in the sense that they do not waste their sparse resources on commodities or single-use products. 
It is not by choice; but their material supplies are dried up and no respite is in sight. Best compared to a frozen total war economy that never relaxed again. 
Their stagnating and regressing economy and ensuing lack of basic amenities is putting severe stress, possibly leading to [[Downfall of Thylyist]].
