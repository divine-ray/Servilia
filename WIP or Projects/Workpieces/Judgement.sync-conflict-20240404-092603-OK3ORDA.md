A pair of glaring eyes piercing through the veil of the night, 
[[cloaked in shadows]], they are aware of their observer, 
staring into the unfortunate soul which ends caught in their glimpse. 
They know what you did; what sins you committed; whom you saved; whom you betrayed.
With thine eyes we see all.
These eyes are yours. 
A blink, and theyâ€˜re gone. 

What will you make of this unlikely concurrence?
Will you change your ways, knowing what you have done?
Or will you carry on living your life, pretending to be innocent?#
