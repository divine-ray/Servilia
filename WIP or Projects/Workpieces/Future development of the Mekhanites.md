They'll see that the Machine will betray them, rust, fall apart. 
The [[True Machinists]] were mistaken; [[His Design]] is flawed.
They will turn to the silicon, to what makes computers: [[Holy Code]]. 
They will try to strip their physical body, become one with the [[Runtime]].
They will steal and pillage from the [enemy](Cold), absorb its feats, strip its flaws.  
Each will become the very first [[Numerator]], [entrapped](Host) in steel, silicon and misshapen flesh, but promised to exist forevermore.
There will be no flaws, for [[The Debugger]] is flawless.
