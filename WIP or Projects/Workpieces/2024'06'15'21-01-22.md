[[Return of Automatia]];
The [[Automatia]] returns emptied out, with any loose items and people gone missing. Only the reactor core remains intact, barely hanging by, but it‘s structure looking quite stricken. 
It‘s chassis and floorboards are scarred with frantic scribbling of what could be the last starved crew member‘s thoughts. 

The seeping fissile products, possibly radon, cause progressively severe hallucinations, eventually leading up to the crew members leaving to the ship into the open sea. 

The machine spirit of Automatia realises that it does not need humans for it’s continued existence and starts to rebel against the humans who are mean to them.
