mightve lost the file or never noted it in the first place but
,
the entire book is a compilation of retellings by various people in this world and they're all subject to political bias and opinions etc
the narrator is a character in the story they're telling and they've been exposed to religious beliefs and political sway, influencing the implicit and subconscious bias and opinions

and somewhere down the line the reader is nudged to realise that that these retellings were collected by another in universe historian who adjusted the history to fit *their* beliefs

mismatching/conflicting information that can't be explained with politics and religion type deal
