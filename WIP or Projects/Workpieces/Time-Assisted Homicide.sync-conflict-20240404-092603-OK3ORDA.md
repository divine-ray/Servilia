Story concept that is about a lover using time travel to go back in time to see their loved one before they committed suicide, only to be trapped in a endless cycle of tragedy and sadness.
They could not prevent the death of their beloved one, despite them being present in the very moment. 

Perhaps that someone stole the timemachine from [[Project Silverspoon]] for their own selfish grief?
