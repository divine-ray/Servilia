for the off-case that we ever write a coherent book/medium: 
the story is compiled of many loose fragments gathered by a historian
all of the fragments are subject to bias, prejudice and political & religious influences
*and* the compiler (historian) is *also* biased, in a way that it elevates the greater scheme into a meta-questioning gaslight
