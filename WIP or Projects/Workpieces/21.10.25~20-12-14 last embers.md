the few, scattered and dying remains of the [[First Light]]
(idk how to continue the sentence)

but!!
some of these embers have been caught in drowned/depth corrupted “amber”, creating something not unlike whats described in the [[Monoatomic Andara Crystal]] 

and I don’t need to tell you that even the deathly-pale fragments of the thing that gave life are still quite powerful on an individual mortal’s pov 

perhaps one or two of these embers were the sparks that created the [[Scarlet Hearth]] and [[Spirits]]/wisps 

and im pretty sure that by the time amida rolls around, these are gone and reduced to super-soot/ash
