Theres something in the water, it spoils it. 
Brown, black, oozing down wherever it touches.
You get hurt from it, you do not belong in it.
No cure for the disease that infects our rivers, streams, creeks. 
It is not poison, it is not toxic, it is not alive.
Foul, as if someone minced a rotting corpse into a vile brew. 
It is not cold and not dry: growth for plagues and infections. 
Those who dared touch the rot or came nearâ€¦
	The bodies were never found. 
		Rumour has it that they turned into the rot.
