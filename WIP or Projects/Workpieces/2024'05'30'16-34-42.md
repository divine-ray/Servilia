A man who goes around town, alluring through his mystery. Shrouded in a long, dragging coat he roams. Mostly hidden behind a mask of leather scraps, but his raspy voice tells tall tales, yet believable. He speaks of foreign lands, those beyond the walls. We know that there is none, so he must be a poet. 
But these tales seem too good, they resonate with what we know. They are of wonder, of mystery that we never have even dared to dream. Everything here makes sense, is conforming to the Grand Design.
Yet he? He tells lies. These are not stories He wrote. These are falsehoods, made to unsettle us. How has he not been caught yet? Someone should call forth investigation on him. 

I want to listen to him, it nags me. I want to believe. I want to think. I want to think that he tells the truth. That we are not the only ones. That there is life beyond these walls, not like those oil-cloaks tell us, that there are people like us. 
Tell me, what are they hiding?

Oh, I cannot answer that to you. They will come after me. You know that. But what you can do..
Tell your friends. Spread the word. Mich√¶l Is In. 

Oh, yes. I will tell, they will know by tomorrow. Come again, stranger and tell your tales.
