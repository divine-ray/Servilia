Consortium of Inventors and Pioneers (CIaP) (c-i-a-p)
An independent organisation of folks capable and willing to experiment with the newest magics, technologies and developments. 
Not formally associated or integrated within the [[Universities and Faculties of Duley]], but working closely together. Specifically, the universities subtly off-load dangerous experiments to avoid damaging their reputation and own equipment. 
Usually accredited (or blamed) for the less stable but more-the-novel devices and contraptions.
