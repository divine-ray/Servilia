The Art of Magic

Kinds of Magic

Currently, there are three different major branches of magic:   

• Light and color

• Life and therefore death

• The one from my DM history, #TODO

These have many different sub-types, but some may form a own branch or a collective “other kinds” branch.

Summoning

The act of summoning is factually the methodical enslavement of jinns, ghouls, goblins and other beings and forcing them to follow your others.

It is a very specialised branch of spell casting, but the arbitrary factor that the summoned beings became bitter and lusting for revenge on their “owners” for centuries of slavery and torture. The nature of these beings will be covered in a separate note.

To begin, the summoner should draw two pentagrams or other ritualistic circles: one for the summoner as protection and another for the summoned being as containment, the slightest error or mistake can cause leaks so that the being can breach out and threaten or kill the summoner. Added to the historic meaning of summoning, the act of doing so forces that being into a physical form that generally annoys to pains twilight beings. Furthermore, its presence is only enforced by the will and lifeblood of the summoner, and their death or extreme fatigue instantly lifts all bounds of the summoned beings, freeing them. This is the reason why they don‘t aid and possibly assist the opposing force in a possibly lethal circumstance.

When casting the initial spell, one should light some incense first that either take a protective  (ex.  weakening the demon) or augmentative (ex. Accelerating the process) role. After doing so, one must drag the desired being from the twilight into this world with a certain set of magical music or reciting lines of text. Presumably, one would want a specific Being that has multiple centuries of experience. For that, one would need a well-cared catalogue of beings. When the demon has been chosen and summoned into this land, one must bind it to oneself and give them instruction(s) and a timeframe for how long they have to stay. It is possible to chain a demon for a lifetime, but this happened so rarely that the effects on both the owner and spirit couldn’t be observed.

It is common and traditional practice to punish or torture spirits with specialised spells if they don’t behave and/or not yield the desired results. 

If someone desires it, it is possible to release spirits into their plane anytime by chanting a formula.

There are ways to trap or bind spirits to dead objects, but this is the area of artifice and infused craftsmanship. 

Golemancy

Giving a original inanimate construct its own motion and possibly some reasoning and independence is truly a marvellous yet dangerous field, maybe even the most destructive known and widespread. This may only be outnumbered by bending the twilight itself.

A golem can be constructed that match the following criteria:  

1. It is as natural as possible.

2. Not harmful for spirits or demons,

3. Either:

a. Soft and bendable easily

b. Intricate mechanical constructions as substitute

4. Can conduct magic and related energies in large scales

The most common and easiest material to use is clay. Materials as gold, iron or wood require complex magic-mechanic interfacing devices as wood and steel can’t bend themselves easily (without certain conditions as time or temperature).

Every golem requires a so-termed eye, which is the remote access control for the caster and a scroll that has spells written on it that work alike to computer programming. This scroll has to be written in the blood of someone experienced in this art (to “fuel” it with the lifeblood of the writer), and it defines the behaviour of the golem. It may either be controlled via eye or by running instructions that run autonomously when uncontrolled.

The “eye” should be installed in the topmost are a of the construct to provide best view. It can used indefinitely until either the owner looses connection, through fatigue or death, or by destruction. The eye can be reused across many many golem constructs.

The scroll containing the animation spell and instructions must be inserted in a body opening of the sculpted being, preferably the mouth if the sculpture resembles a human(oid). If a opening at that spot is present, its also possible to use the heart, head, or belly chakra.  When inserted into other places (which might just be surface) the golem might not behave as desired.

In the moment the scroll is fully inserted, the written magic and lifeblood energy escapes it and transfers to the inactive construct to and burning the scroll in the process of “starting up” the golem.

Depending on how the animation spell is constructed, the golem can take on one of the following functions:

• To act like a rigid computer script, executing a number of directives and operators

• To act as remote controlled construct

• Or to be an extension or override to the mind of the constructor, effectively giving them a overpowered avatar.

Although it is not advised, some modern wielders reported success in installing modern devices such as military ordnance and electronic devices on golems. Risks are currently unknown, but one might be that both technology and magic starts to function in unwanted ways such as a connection loss or re-shaping of golem scripts with digital code. Experience has shown that fusing silicon semiconductor technology and magic of any kind clashes direly.

It is to mention that each golem autonomously drains from a multitude of power sources, from the constructor’s lifeblood, to even electricity (if possible) over stored/accumulated magic in the environment or relics, making a golem almost indestructible when made correctly. 

Another crucial ability of golems is that they can repair damages when given time and material. 

The only known and few ways to eliminate such a construct would be to somehow remove the eye, make the construction unconscious, or to blast it with raw force that the construct gets torn apart.

Yet the most effective method is to remove the remains of the parchment from the golem.

As said above, a animation spell written on a scroll channels the writer’s lifeblood and energy, meaning a average wielded can only write a single scroll in their lifetime and survive. The first few lines of another one would kill them in very short time. When damaged or torn apart, all stored potential energy gets released in a uncontrolled manner, likely manifesting in temperature changes or throwing waves at the twilight, dragging the attention of spirits and other beings.

Spell casting

One of the, if not the best known arts of magic is spell casting, the channeling of raw twilight potential into work that influences matter and objects, possibly space-time itself. Depending on the complexity and effect of the spell casted, it might no to extensive precautions such as protective barriers, incenses, and possibly the combined power and potential from multiple energies or sacrifices.

The raw potential, which is the energy harnessed from several sources, must be condensed into a storage or used immediately or it will cause unwanted effects which might cause catastrophes. It is possible to store potential in special devices and amulets, to be released at a later point. Possible sources are listed here, but as examples and not complete whatsoever: tapping the twilight from its energy which is the power radiated away from sentient beings, power of life itself from blood, death and lifeblood, the entropic energy accumulated from one beingexhausted or generally negative. 

Most common is twilight tapping or draining oneself of lifeblood, since both can have absurdly high yielding resources(imagine tapping entirety of humanity for a single spell…).

Modern wielders are experimenting on converting chemical and physical energy to potential, like a power plant, although this is highly unstable and in development. With some workarounds, its possible to use magic into electricity. 

The complexity of a spell determines the cost and efforts which are needed to take place in order to cast that spell. The actual costs in potential and lifeblood is determined by how much matter and beings are influenced or affected. This means a spell which covers a large is more costly than those which cover a small area. 

The protective measures hinted at beforehand are necessary if the caster does want to survive the chaotic outcrops and erratic behaviours sourcing from the raw unharnessed potential. They manifest as poisonous clouds, smoke or fog, hazardous chemicals that dissolve quickly, electric discharge arcs, and temporary modification of matter like gravity, appearance and waves, including temperature and light. it is either possible to contain the spell or the casters involved but latter would require the destructive effects to be grounded in some way such as storing it in a suited object or tunnelling into somewhere irrelevant where it doesn’t bother anyone or anything. 

Each wielder advanced enough is capable of creating their own spells and documenting them for others, but creative process can easily be seen as one of the most sophisticated and complicated specialisations of magical arts.

Please take note that it’s possible to cast spells and bind them to any object to release the actual effect later. Some people reported to enhanced firearms with this or channeled the destructive force into explosives, making them much more potent and adding a warcrime to another. 

Some wielders may find it helpful to bind their spells onto small objects that can be carried in pouches and such, to quickly cast them when needed. Naturalist wielders use this strategy the most.
