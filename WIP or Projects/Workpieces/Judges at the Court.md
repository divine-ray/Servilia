The one haunted by a [[Spectre]] - 
Those unfortunate souls to be cursed, be wretched, 
The ones awaiting [[Judgement]].
Convicts, of sorts. They do not know the rules, nor are they informed of their trial.
This is unjust, some may say. And indeed, it is. Lest these judges are laden with responsibility. 
They need to persecute and enforce their laws and rules.
But why, it is heard. The reply is usually of higher order, greater good or simply just cause.

It is arbitration. 

And who, who are these self appointed and empowered judges, calls the outcry. 
They are those who meet the fates at the other end of the [[Court of Storms]]. On a frequent basis, a taxing task.

The spectre is nothing more than a fabricated, invoked observer. Lest it beckons to become the executioner as well; a being disembodied seeks shelter in flesh.
