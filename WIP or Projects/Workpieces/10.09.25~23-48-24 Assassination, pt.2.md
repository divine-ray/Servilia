regarding the shooting of fucking Kirk recently I am, kinda, now shuffling shit around since i feel connections to [[31.07.25~08-14-21 (Assassination)]]
which led me to two conclusions:
1. I wanted - and still want to - write news(paper) articles for in-world things, and this situation for kirk or [[high-ranking individual]] cause(s/d) a massive fuckin outrage
2. I didnt really twiddle my thumbs regarding [[ISONS]]’ organisation, and would more so expect this to be a matter and affair of their corpo’s security and whatnot, since ISONS is specifically protecting Iterators
3. I did not figure out names and people and stuff of/on the corpos
