[[Eutectic NaK Coolant]] - [[Fusion]] 
this only applies to post-veil (woven) mechs ! ! ! 

What kind of wacky and other questionable energy generation methods can we come up with, specifically for compact, self-contained power sources for MECHs?
cold fusion surely sounds like a Thing, alternatively MCF, but we need to come up with some way of generating muons that does not cause a net loss of energy or require a gigantic accelerator or facility
hrm, what if we give them muon "batteries" which are full of exotic matter from beyond the veil, which use some near quantum/weave shenanigans to always have some muons in the cell 
ok according to wiki, muons primarily occur from cosmic rays and whatnot
so, what if, we just pump the eternal ocean into these cells, which might as well be liquified cosmos and thus an extremely potent radiation source
sure the collection process itself may be incredibly energy intensive, but it does not matter if we make what boils down into cosmic and stupid dangerous synfuels
and for the output part we "just" use a magnetohydrodynamic generator to extract electricity from the plasma 
and frankly, if this technology of ocean batteries sees success in veil-capable MECHs, i would also assume that they will bend spacetime/internal gravity to catalyse the reaction even further.
