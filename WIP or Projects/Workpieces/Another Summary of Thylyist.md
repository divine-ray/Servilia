Originally, in the past, their[^1] [God](Mekhane) fought in wars and met destruction, fell into pieces, which got scattered across the lands and times, with the religion shattered, their remains reforming and entasked to reassemble them. they ended up betraying this quest and became sick with power.

The present is a zealous/religious empire worshipping a dead machine-god.
However his is only one of the three or four major [Factions](Faction%20Overview). They are covered elsewhere. 
The Future is a cyberpunk hyper-dystopic corrupt megalopolis.

[[Empire of Thylyist|Thylyist]] in it’s current state is said religious preacher elite caste holding a iron grip over their citizens, enforcing propaganda and doctrine, all in the name of their god who has been reduced into a tool for their rhetoric

And this addition would provide a logical bridge for the empire of Thylyist to decay from the insides though the hands of the True Machinists to the futuristic Amida and all that entails

Effectively, through recent events, a splinter group of Mekhane’s Followers has gained notable influence and power, driven by their belief that the followers are abusing and raping the blessed machine, against it’s divine purpose.
These so-called true machinists strive to break the dogmatism of regression and paralysed development, while also rejecting the human flesh as to embrace their deity through themselves.

So the True Machinists are scheming to overthrow the Followers and their zealots and vanguard to embrace the outside world again, as they have been locked down in their fortifications for generations.

[^1]: Of the humans, called Mekhane.
