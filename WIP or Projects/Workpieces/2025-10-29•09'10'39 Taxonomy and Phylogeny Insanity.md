RE: [[Project Integration]] - come up with a somewhat waterproof implementation of taxonomy and/or phylogeny applying to all our fucked up and warped creatures
also, #TODO come up with a word or descriptor for entities like [[Steelver]]s and [[Eyewitness]]es, since they’re neither “divine” (in the sense of godly) but also not really “corrupted” (turned into a worse, more fucked up version) *nor* “ascended” 
is “warped” what we’re looking for? but thats laaaame 🥱
