The  [[Scarlet]] Core; its steady heartbeat pumping flame and heat throughout the [[Long Savannah]], bursting into [[Steam Gardens]]. Epicentre and origin to the [[Scorched Acres]]. 
It does not resemble a heart, at least not one of a human. It is more so a unshapely clump of minerals refusing to melt for good, fused with something resembling flesh. But it can’t be flesh, as it’d get burnt into chars instantly. 
Is it draconic?
Fed by the flames, yet feeding the heat, something pretending to be an organism in perpetuum mobile. Possibly empowered by the [[Searing Lode]], yet unverified as nobody but the [[Children of The Flame]] are truly aware of its vast veins spanning across the Long Savannah.  

Nobody knows how the heart got into the [[Castle on A Hill]]. Or was the castle erected with the heart in mind, entombing it?

Some egghead called it a glorified, enshrined magic water pump. Oh dear.
