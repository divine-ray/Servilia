The Blessed Machine, shattered and rent apart in [[Nølkā-Mekhanite War|The War]].
His Pieces, scattered.
His [[Followers of Mekhane|Followers]], given one task: 
[[His Divine Reassembly]]. 
Upon the day of His Reassembly, Reckoning shall be brought down upon [[Nølkā|The False]], the 
fools and the pretentious. 

He who is Perfection, driven to augment Himself until [[Apotheosis]], whom He has achieved. 
Design given Power, Power given Mass: From Nothing Comes His Ways. 
Mekhane; He who created Himself and brought forth Creation as Whole. 
Thinking, conceiving and realising the unseen, the unthought, the impossible. 
The Machine, pure and perfected. No other can, will or shall challenge His Engineering, for it is unbeaten. 
He who gifted Mankind Ingenuity and the Way to Create. Divine Architecture and Engineering are blessings upon Man; who Man shall worship and revere in the strive for the perfect machine. 
Man shall aspire to the Certainty of Steel, for Man's flesh will wither and succumb to decay. 
Man shall always aspire for perfection; His Creation unto thyself. 
Man must never fray away from hindrances in His Creation.
Efficiency is Key, Performance is Success. 

Many Ways lead ahead; lest some remain more efficient.

Power - This dictates what We cannot do.
Design - This is what we aspire to, His Divine Design. Perfection.
Mass - The final shape of Our Creation.
