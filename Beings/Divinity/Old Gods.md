Divinity in its highest, purest, most potent form:
Entities that defy the meaning of time and space, existing everywhere at any moment and yet nowhere. 
Intellects without bounds, beyond any concept which a human mind could conceive. 

And yet, they show ties, as if of distant family, to mundane concepts known and exploited by humans.
An omnipresent, omniscient `presence|absence`.
