God?
Who is it?
Who calls themselves The Creator, among a realm where divinity is but a trait, a property that can be amassed like money?
All there is for a god is a scheme of lies and smoke; as nobody, not even the transcended ones, can compete. 
	But with what, a questioning one may ask.
	The answer: There is none.
Many divinities have previously called themselves “The One God”, but they all fell from belief and power as their exposé made them vulnerable. 
Vulnerable to the *[[Nølkā|god-eaters]]*. 
Their soul devoured, our realm is left with many-a shambling [[Corse]] - the fleshy shell of divinity, severed from its devoured spirit. 

Only ascended humans are so foolish, selfish and egotistical to call themselves The One. Divinity only thrives in pantheons, the heavenly ecosystems, in which every deity is responsible for their protectorate. Those who tried to seize others failed; spoilt themselves; fell to the rot. 
Yes, the [[Rot]] devours.
