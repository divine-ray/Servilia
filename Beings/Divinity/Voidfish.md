The manifestation of [[Realms/Planes/Dark Domain/The Void|The Void]], appearing as gigantic glowing jellyfish, swimming through an infinity of nothing at the bottom of the [[Astral Ocean]]. 

Easily considered to be one of the major antagonistic forces, as it envies the material plane of its details and features.
