The manifestation of [[Realms/Planes/Dark Domain/The Void|The Void]], appearing as gigantic glowing jellyfish floating above an infinity of nothing.
Easily considered to be one of the major antagonistic forces, as it envies the material plane of it's details and features. 

Witnessing this apparition already allows the Void into the mind of the observer, tearing it to shreds in it's eternal rage and envy. 
It is suspended in eternal envy and jealousy turned wrath against the material plane and the [[celestials]] for being something, whilst it is the absolute nothing. 
It's constant wrath and agony is making it 'scream', manifesting various odd or anomalous phenomenon in the [[Eternal Sea]], which eventually extends to the planets. A sufficiently advanced civilisation might be able to receive these screams as scrambled and incoherent radio transmissions.
