The Queen of Shadows is a being from #Beyond who rules over the shadow realm.
She's a [[ShnÅ«t]] , to be precise. 
Laid in a constant conflict with [[The Navigator]], for their intents are clashing. 
Every action of one is negated by the other, forming a eternal dancing duel between the two. 


She appears as a infinitely long and massive worm, which is merely constructed from a many floating rings that, given the nature of this realm, eventually trail off into the darkness. 
The front end shapes as several shield shaped segments orbiting a ring, mimicking chelicerae. 

Involved into the eternal fight of light vs dark as both the victim and offender.
She defends the [[Empire of Shadows|shadow realm]] fiercely against intruders and foreign beings, but cares for her kin and servants wholeheartedly.
