A critter originating from the [[Northern Reaches]]. Distantly related to the marine hermit crab, these land crustaceans have evolved to use the deadwood of the [[Black Forest]] as their shells.

It appears that they prefer the lowermost sections of trees, presumably to aid their guise.
Their environment has forced them to adapt a very slow lifecycle, with the oldest reported specimen dating up to a hundred years. Woodcarriers hardly have successful offspring, with an average individual giving birth to an alleged maximum of three. 
In this timespan they use up a lot of deadwood, which agitates the local ecosystem. 
Recent concerns regarding the rising population have been spoken, claiming that the woodcarriers might start to damage healthy and fine trees.
