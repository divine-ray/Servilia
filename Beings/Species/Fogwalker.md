Guardian of the [[Lunar Mangroves]], these beings stride their way on flimsy stilts of bare naked bone.
Shrouded in the thick mist of the mangroves during day, they are never truly seen, as the walkers anvoid artificial light from intruders at day.
A sleek, towering build allows them to oversee over the treetops without disrupting the fragile forest below them.
Standing tall on eight legs and two extended mandible-arms, they pose a fright to anyone who glimpses upon them. However, despite their imposing appearance, they are rather calm creatures who graze on the treetops. 
Only if they spot artificial light challenging the moons, they become active and pursue the disturbance and rend it apart to feed on the remains, to water the mangroves with the blood.
