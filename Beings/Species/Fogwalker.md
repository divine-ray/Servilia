Guardian of the [[Lunar Mangroves]], these beings stride their way on flimsy stilts of bare naked bone.
Shrouded in the thick mist of the mangroves during day, they are never truly seen, since the walkers seek out artificial light from intruders.
A sleek, towering build allows them to oversee over the treetops without disrupting the fragile forest below them.
Standing tall on eight legs and two extended mandible-arms, they pose a fright to anyone who glimpses upon them. However, despite their imposing appearance, they are rather calm creatures who only graze off the treetops.
