Clay vessels, covered and usually filled with mire and tar.
Intricately decorated like gargantuan grave gifts or religious antiquities. 
Their origin unknown, yet they wander the dunes of the long savannah and [[Scorched Acres]]. 

Oftentimes found in large herds, like flocks of sheep and cattle, but without any shepherd. 

Never inspected up close as their massive apothecaries, held high up by strands and tendrils of tar, instil dread and fear towards local folks and oftentimes cause them to move or flee.
Despite their terrifying appearance they are docile, placid. Almost oblivious of their surroundings as they roam the endless sands.

These are one of the few creatures not having undergone extensive study and research compared to other unusual life in Servilia due to their massive size and presumed threat. 
Their origin is only speculated upon, but some theories suggest that the tar is mobilised crude oil (which, in turn, has piqued the interest of [[Development of Petrochemistry]]) from subterran deposits.

All experiments and endeavours to restrain and "domesticate" these have failed, always taking lives with them.
