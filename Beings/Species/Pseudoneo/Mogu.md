As the Lavish continued their (repeatedly backfiring) experimentations and research into self-adapting and -modifying life, some eventually conceived an amorphous organism, with even less internal structure than the red plague/Cold/Scarlet.
Their goal was to conceive and create a pseudoneo species capable of retooling itself for *any* task imaginable. It was this pseudoneo that - for the short time it operated - greatly benefitted their endeavours of arcane engineering, as it was built with conductivity and channelling in mind. 
However, they oversaw to limit the conductivity, which led to ==It== staring beyond the material plane, and out into the twilit. 
This unrestricted access led to notable damages and trauma on behalf of the twilit, whilst elevating It to powers deemed divine; restricted to ascendants and beyond. 
Its fluid, liquid nature, paired with intellect, enables them to easily copy any object or entity desired or commanded to. It inherited this ability from [[Sleeker]]s. However, despite countless refinements since Sleekers, it is still not perfect, and any such copy can be distinguished upon closer inspection. However, It’s access to the twilit enabled it to manipulate observers into believing that the mimicked object is genuine. 

It was this species of 'neo that finally stopped the Lavish from creating new life. It was not the heresy against divinity and humanity embodied in the [[Vaaruú]] that brought them down, it was these. *These things*, that defied all that was considered solid order and law of nature were the breaking point of the Lavish Pseudoneo projects.
