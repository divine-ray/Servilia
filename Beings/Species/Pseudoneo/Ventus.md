*Singular: Ventu*
Members of the [[Empire of Winds]], descendants of [[Songbird|Songbirds]], adapted to the brutal climate of [[Northern Reaches]]. Perfected hunter-gatherers, always ill-tempered and out for bloodshed. 
Only the adaptation and bond to their climate is holding them back from conquest and sieging the mainland. 
Avian in nature, yet some have traded their high-altitude flight for close-ground soaring and glides, some prefer dashing.
