*Singular: Dwarv*
[[Pseudoneo]] created by the [[Lavish]] to exploit the back-then newly arisen [[Hollow Mountains]] for resources. 


In the subterranean ecosystem of the mountains, the Dwarves are rather high up, yet not the apex predator in the food chain, which led them to develop and create metallic body plating and amour, embedded and embossed onto their very bodies. These platings have been observed to be akin to human clothing, as they convey important information such as age and status. 

They're responsible for the rising instability of the mountains as they're only held up by the dwindling power of the fountainhead and rotting supports.


They do not use tools, but their bodies to mine minerals and carve rock. For humanoids, the digging implements of Dwarves are highly valued for their sturdiness and fabled ability to cut everything. However, these implements are part of their bodies, and no dwarv ever has given it up willingly. 
Built to resist all what the harsh business of mining throws at them, they are tough and compact creatures. 

Certain splinter and renegade groups have been commercialising their prowess in mining and metalworking, primarily selling to the Frisco Confederation and Thylyist (incognito).
Aside from that, they do take a important role in the Phylum of pseudoneo ecosystem, as they're capable and willing to augment, maintain and recreate parts of other pseudoneo individuals.
