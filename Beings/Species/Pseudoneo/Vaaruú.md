Synthetic beings, brought unto this realm by the [[ti-mud'ĝál Ĝiš-hur]] ([[ti-mud'ĝál Ĝiš-hur|Create Life Plan]]), initiated and ran by the [[Lavish]], [[Empire of Thylyist|Thylyist]] and [[Dragonkin]] in a era-defining collaboration. 

Composed and crafted, these beings remain the pinnacle of [[Timeline of Pseudoneo Developments|Pseudoneo creation]].  

Take the human body, strip it of it's weak heart and frail bones. Drain it's blood. Shed it's skin. 
Give it a heart of eons, one of Dragonkin. Bones shall be forged in hellfire, mined from the darkest depths. Blood of temper but supple, that of aquatic legacy. Coat this masterpiece in softened metal scales. 

Yes, this but have to do. Go forth, children, become the new humanity. 
***
We will settle you into [[Làma'el-iri]]; a city worthy of your kin, created in your image, superior to any and all building before, it shall be but appropriate to your skills and capabilities. 
***
We did it! We seized immortality before the gods! Through what we call [[Liches]] we can grant eternal life!
***
But our attempts were void, null. We underestimated how much we forced the humanoid body through, the children are all weak and fragile. They cannot give birth, we had to teach them to construct another. We are afraid of the [[Songbird|Songbird]] happening again. 
But we have to abandon our control for them to replace us, we must not loose hope. 
***
Vanquished by the god-destroying hubris of Man in [[Second Mekhanite War|the genocide sweep]]. Their city reduced to traumatised ruins only known as [[Tombstone]]. A warning memorial against hubris.
