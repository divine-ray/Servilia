An exclusively subterranean crustacean easily identified by the sizable mineraloid formations growing on their back.
There seems to be a domesticated species or version ranched by [[Dwarves]], presumably for harvesting the mineral growths.

It appears that they are able to digest rock and sediment dust, which they make by using their massive claw, capable of crushing loose rubble and debris. 
After digestion and absorption, the consumed wmaterial is allowed to crystallise on their back.
Domesticated crystalbearers are reported to be fed a pulpy mixture which already is free of common sediments to speed up the formations. 

The few reports available have described them as very doctile and slow-moving. It is unsure whether this is an effect of the domestication or if that is the wild form. This sluggish metabolism and activity allows them a great lifespan easily excelling 300 Terran Equivalent Years.
