Some canine that fell towards [[The Cold]]. 
Preferred food by [[Will]].

Almost a cube walking on legs, some spiky bits of fur standing off.
Rather clumsy, but not to be underestimated in packs, which is their preferred hunting strategy. 
Has adapted to their novel shape and form, utilising it by launching itself at foes in efforts to impact blunt force.
