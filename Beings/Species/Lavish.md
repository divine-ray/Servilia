Lavish were^[Extinct on Servilia as of [[The Second Era]].] sentient and crafty descendants of a lucky hybrid of octopuses and squids that called highly oxygenated, clear waters their home.
They primarily fed on aquatic microorganisms (<1cm) and rarely off black smoker ecosystems.
Through the superior dexterity gained by their tentacles, this species has mastered both magic and conventional technology and was capable of fusing those into [[Pseudoneo|artificial life]].
Their dexterity and intellect has catapulted them into the most advanced race of the continent even [[Before the First Era|before humans picked up a rock.]] 
For the central nation that resided in the [[Palga Basin]] refer to the [[The Lavish Empire|Lavish Empire]]. 
## Anatomy
Their body is generally elongated and mostly soft, spare for their mouth organ and a protective plate in the main body of a hardness varying between tribes. 
At the pointed end of their body sit two muscular fins for eased steering during propulsion, which also act as weak means of reorienting. 
Their 'skin' features an abundance of chromatophores which they use for (primarily subconcious) communication. Informational communication is performed through clacking with their mouth and gestures in their six lesser tentacles. 
The mouth organ was the first subject of their tinkering, and has ever since been reinforced with metal. 
Lavish feature two water jets driven from individual muscle sacs, one stronger for locomotion and the second one weaker and smaller for precise manipulation of their environment. 
They wield eight tentacles, two of which are longer, without suction cups and flattened to act as rudder. The other six are shorter, about two thirds of their total body length and outfitted with suction cups, acting as their primary means of interacting with the world. 

Their dexterity and intellect has catapulted them into the most advanced race of the continent even [[Before the First Era|before humans picked up a rock.]]
