Lavish were sentient and crafty descendants of molluscs (squid, octopi) that called highly oxygenated, clear waters their home.
They primarily fed on aquatic microorganisms (<1cm) and rarely off black smoker ecosystems.
Through the superior dexterity gained by their tentacles, this species has mastered both magic and conventional technology and was capable of fusing those into [[Pseudoneo|artificial life]].
