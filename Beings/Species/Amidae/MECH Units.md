*something about mechas.* 
MECH stands for Mobile Entity / Combat Hybrid. 
For aerial units please refer to [[ACE-V|ACE/V]] units (Aerial Combat Entity/Vehicle).

Those classes directly controlled or assisted by a humanoid are divided between piloted units and operated units. 
Both operators and pilots insist on being distinguished from one another, in addition to not being seen as "common" infantry, which many users deem inferior.
Piloted units are used with a [[SUIT Interfaces|SUIT Interface]]. 
Operated units are notably more complex, usually C.1 or C.2 and requiring [[Gel Tank Plights|Plights]]. It is strictly necessary to use a [[MODI Suits|MODI]] to translate between human neural activity and the combination of digital processing and synthetic neural activity present in MECHs. 
Direct [[Standard Neural Interface|interfaces]], with translation inbuilt into the plight or mech, are deemed feasible and may be entering initial prototyping first. 
## Intelligence Classifications
In other documents, the classification is abbreviated into C.1-C.4
The Intellect piloting a mobile combat unit is classified under three categories:
1. Autonomous
	 Fully independent cognition, capable of reasoning and own actions. 
 2. Hybrid
	 A subclass of 1.: Autonomous, these systems are oriented around providing assistance to a humanoid pilot, but can steer the unit with little to decent flexibility on its own.
 3. Restricted
	 Limited cognition, able to execute complex tasks independently of a human, but not capable of improvising. This class is favoured by [[ISONS]] and [[Numerator|Numerators]] as they can be directly linked to a numerator. 
4. Blind, Deaf, Dumb (BDD)
	 Barely considered intelligent, these units extend the pilot and thus cannot act independently.  
## Overarching Classes
MECHs fill these roles:
- main battle tank [[Warhammer]] on six/eight legs, autonomous entity with rationale intellect
- scout unit using digitigrade bipedal stride, barely armoured but extremely agile, hybrid piloting (soldiers + AI)
- Troop Transport and APC in a quadruped frame, steered by a autonomous intelligence
- Heavy biped BDD, doubling as second battle unit.
- quadrupedal restricted + pilot recon/stealth unit, lightly armed, designed for agility and stealth
- Hexapod ([[Scarab]])/octopedal insectoid unit with restricted cognition, primarily for handling cargo and logistics. 
	Can raise up its two front limbs to act as manipulators (Like a forklift). 
- Feline-oriented sniper unit using restricted intel, quadrupedal stride. 
- Digitigrade bipedal unit for close-quarter melee combat. AI/Hybrid.
- [[MEER-C.A.T.]] - quadruped surveiliance and recon unit
