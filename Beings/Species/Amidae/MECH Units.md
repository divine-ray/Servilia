*something about mechas.* 
MECH stands for Mobile Entity / Combat Hybrid. 
For aerial units please refer to [[ACE-V|ACE/V]] units (Aerial Combat Entity/Vehicle).
## Intelligence Classifications
The Intelligence piloting a mobile combat unit is classified under three categories:
1. Autonomous
	 Fully independent cognition, capable of reasoning and own actions. 
 2. Hybrid
	 A subclass of 1.: Autonomous, these systems are oriented around providing assistance to a humanoid pilot, but can steer the unit with little to decent flexibility on its own.
 3. Restricted
	 Limited cognition, able to execute complex tasks independently of a human, but not capable of improvising.
4. Blind, Deaf, Dumb (BDD)
	 Barely considered intelligent, these units extend the pilot and thus cannot act independently.  
## Overarching Classes
MECHs fill these roles:
- main battle tank [[Warhammer]] on six/eight legs, autonomous entity with rationale intellect
- scout unit using digitigrade bipedal stride, barely armoured but extremely agile, hybrid piloting (soldiers + AI)
- Troop Transport and APC in a quadruped frame, steered by a autonomous intelligence
- Heavy biped BDD, doubling as second battle unit.
- quadrupedal restricted + pilot recon/stealth unit, lightly armed, designed for agility and stealth
- Hexapod ([[Scarab]])/octopedal insectoid unit with restricted cognition, primarily for handling cargo and logistics. 
	Can raise up its two front limbs to act as manipulators (Like a forklift). 
- Feline-oriented sniper unit using restricted intel, quadrupedal stride. 
- Digitigrade bipedal unit for close-quarter melee combat. AI/Hybrid.
