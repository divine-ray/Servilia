A telecomm model called the MEER-C.A.T (Mechanized Engineered Escorting and Reconnaissance and CAT can be something like Communications-Assistance Transport/Technician).
It is a normally quadrupedal medium height, light weight MECH that serves as a mobile telecommunications array of antennas and the like when it stands, on top of engaging surveillance systems so it does like a meercat and analyses the whole terrain and relays all info before sitting back down.
