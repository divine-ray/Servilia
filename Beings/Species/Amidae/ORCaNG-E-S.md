> Organic Reinforced Core and Neurogenesis Environment Suit

The sophisticated descendant of the [[APE-S]], ORaNG-E-S are created with a fully independent organic core, including a neural structure hosting an intellect. Graded Restricted-Hybrid, this intellect is tasked to maintain integrity of its chassis and the operator, to which autonomy during off-use has been granted.

Prototype testing and experimentation has proven very promising, reporting zero casualties and only minor fractures and lesser damage to armour plating during live firing.
It is required to mention that a portion of the test group (total of 20 testers, three of which mentioned) were reluctant or even refusing to disengage their ES. Two thirds were persuaded into disengaging, with the remaining tester being chosen to undergo long-term (>1wk) wielding.
