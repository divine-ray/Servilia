#Undead #enemies 

A poor undead fellow who succumbed to the [[Curse of the Undead]].
Most of them are located in the infirmary of [[Sepulchre]].

Some make weak attempts to attack their environment in their deranged condition, dealing 1d4-1 unarmed strike.
Some roam the Realm aimlessly due to lacking a motivation.

They can get helped if they receive [[Bottled Embers]] from any source. 
What little remains of the human and animal does know that the embers bring betterment, and will present a mindless fierceness to get their hold on the warmth. This behaviour is rather troublesome in stationary treatment of these.
