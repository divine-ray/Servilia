## Body
This dragon features a elegant and short body with slender tail and neck. Their scales are primarily black but some areas are iridescent, markedly those which receive stress often, so on joints and flexible parts. Outside of those some areas have iridescence, I depended of stress, similar to erroring pigmentation. It takes about a year to replace all scales, including those which got stressed into iridescence (wear slowly changes them).

This species has short powerful limbs with four digits on each foot, each featuring a short but retractable claw, which, depending on age, vary from 30mm (newborn to toddler) to 50mm (elder) over around 90mm (mid aged adult).  
They are capable of exhaling a narcotic gas, which might act as hallucinogenic agent but is deadly in higher dose (roughly more than ¼ of the lung volume). The potency scales with age but drops when becoming elderly.
## Wings
Their wings are set up in pairs of two per side. Those do not, unlike others, have a main structural bone but instead a membrane spanning over a network of fragile thin gristle and sinew. The structural support is carried out by having few lines of the aforementioned network thickened to support the construct. Although rounded at the end, a very sharp talon tangents off each wing. There are three total spots/lines where the individual can bend it without taking damage: in a lightly bent line from top to bottom and on each third of the wing. This species uses folding points to coordinate the simultaneous movement of all wings to avoid collision with itself, giving it the ability to hover for prolonged time. All wings have their origin on a triangular bulged section of the body.

This section also serves as main air intake method by loose segments covering the opening of the tracheae. They connect from shoulder to half-way of the torso.

## Spine protrusions and sensory clusters
Each spine grows out the back into a arched thin bone which has a membrane connecting to the base of the next one. Those membrane protrusions are unfoldable on will and the membrane can shift color slightly. Because every spine segment has one of those, they run from the head to down to the tail end. Spread throughout their body is a network of sensory clusters which have a different texture, structure and color. Those are dotted regularly on the sides and joints of leg and wing.  It’s important to know that interacting with those clusters in any way gets taken into active consciousness much faster and way more intense. It is possible to generate arousal if they are hit in the right way, based on personal preference.

## Head and Eyes
This species’ head is wide and arrow-shaped but round on corners and tip.

Their split nostrils are primarily for sensing airborne substances and smells. They do not have ears but the nostrils do this job and pick up sound. Flaps of scale-less skin allow to completely close the nostrils and air intake, allowing for putting the head underwater without great discomfort. Their teeth are shaped towards a omnivorous diet and all four canine (corner) teeth protrude slightly from the maw, the rest covered your by a equivalent of lips. Their jaw is fleeting and rounded.  
Together with the nostrils it looks like this dragon got eight eyes, out of which six are actual eyes. The main eye does not have a defined colour and covers the entire colour spectrum. Said main eye picks up the visible light spectrum. The lower right eye is responsible for picking up infrared radiation/light and is thus coloured in a deep-pink to reddish colour. The opposing eye on lower left senses ultraviolet light and is coloured purple to deep blue.  
All eyes are capable of moving independently but are usually paired to avoid confusion.

The main visible-light-eyes are slightly offset and can look forward.

The scales on their back half to end of their head grow way faster than usual. It is possible for them to work this like human hair due to flexibility and lack of nerves in there.[^1]

During adulthood each of the longest strings of scale hair will harden into individual horns that house their magnetic sense. Because they harden over time, it is possible for each individual to shape their horns to their liking. This magnetic sense allows them to locate metallic objects from up to about 50 meters away, again, range depending on age.

### Tendrils

In total four thin tendrils origin from above and under the lips, two per, respectively. The upper ones are longer than those from the lower jaw. A adhesive substance coating the lower tendrils aids in eating food or cleaning around the mouth. Note that these are considerably strong and can lift up to around 100kg when used together.

## Colour changing

This species is able to temporarily change the appearance of all scales by shaking their body. The iridescent scales may change colour at any time given. Although they are capable of this, they do not use it frequently as its very exhausting. In a subconscious way, the colour of the spine membranes iridescent scales and, less intense, sensory clusters/nodes indicate mood or mental state of that individual.

## Mating and reproduction

Interestingly, this species is capable of both life birth and egg laying, depending on the pregnant female. She has to pick between incubating the egg(s) inside or outside.

But because it takes up to  █████ (which translates to about 39 Schi'an years) to reach independence of the parents, a couple may only have up to ca. 10 successful children in their entire lifetime. The genitalia of this species, both male and female, is hidden in a internal pocket. “Unpacking” of sorts from this pocket is a slow procedure that can hurt if executed too fast.

### Mating cycle and -behaviour

Their mating cycle is quite irregular and easily disturbed, but mainly follows Terran moon phases. On new moon and thus the darkest night possible[^2], each individual emits large a puts of sexual pheromones, often causing orgies in dense populated areas.

During pregnancy, the sensory clusters closes to the female genitalia grow into the equivalent of teats, if the child(s) are born before being able to consume regular food. Those teats will be rejected by the body as soon as the child(s) can eat pre-chewed food.

## Genetic Deviation

All of those aforementioned traits and features are just a representation of what the average individual of this species bears. It’s important to be aware that they got a large genetic drift and instability, which changes up most of the described parts per generation, to a point where this description looses validity. This also covers sexuality, which makes averagely speaking rare oddities like hermaphroditism, inter*sexual and androgyne individuals notably more common.

## Temperature and Metabolism

Their metabolism is slightly affected by the environmental temperature, but it is possible for them to change the temperature in a short radius[^3] by storing energy chemically and releasing it later.

Their digestion and excretion is highly optimised and wasting only the least possible amount of matter. They are able to compound body wastes like birds to, ridding their sexual organs of the secondary purpose to urinate. Because their wastes are highly concentrated, they are forced to move in short time after settling down to not poison the area.

## Sexuality

After being born, children will only have a big sensory cluster at their crotch which only grows into genitals after that individual has decided which gender, if any, they want to represent. This cluster is responsible for lust and pleasure from there on but looses the ability to easy change, yet it is still possible, up to two times in a lifespan. In each local community, this process of firstly growing genitals has a high cultural value with a similar recognition and audacity as turning legally adult (18/21 years old) in human society.  
In this ritual of becoming an adult, the individual also gets to choose their own name as replacement for the placeholder name given by the parents or a nickname adopted from friends and such. For the sake of identification and organisation, a coequal of human family names exist. Those are a descriptive short sentence from where that family or tribe first formed. This is usually neglected as this species does not form settlements or seek urban areas where a lot of their people are.  
Examples of this pattern would look like:

·         Phillip John of the hilly plains
·         Antares from the northern ocean
·         Polaris from upper ice

Also of high cultural value is the ability to, as said, change the genitals in a very time consuming process where individuals usually isolate into monk-like states and focus their body on changing their genitals. Lest someone has enough determination to accomplish this, they will usually have a high reputation from being able to shape their body. It’s considered the usual or norm if someone longs for changing gender, and individuals which do near-always receive a lot of motivation and support to do so.


## Culture

Through time and experience, the species-wide agreement to avoid humans, if contact isn’t necessary, has been made. Although some members of this species may disrespect this and live among humans, it is common for dragons of this kin to trade goods and knowledge with humans and other beings.

Knowledge is the most valued good in their culture. Because of this, a individual rarely settles permanently but to travel the world and places to quench their thirst for knowledge.

This makes them a reliable spreader and source of world-wide knowledge.

Individuals of this kin which provide courier services are not as honoured as other couriers yet makes them a good part of communication and sharing.

Their body and condition is seemingly made for normandy and travel since they can hover and rest one pair of wings to save energy.

### Genitals

#### Female genitalia

The female genitalia consists out of a narrow tunnel and a large cavity to store the eggs and load. The tunnel is small enough to make the partner feel the internal structure and ripples. After what’s the average male length the tunnel goes over into the cavity which has a smoother surface. When enticed enough, a female will give off a large quantity of juices, in such a quantity that a human could drink almost steadily off it, but it stops when the cavity is filled to about to 10-25% and warmed to 30°C-40°C.  
The entry is blocked with never less than three large (overlapping) scales, which have to be torn off first. Depending on how this seal is removed, it may feel like nothing, pleasurable, or painful. This seal will recover itself over the span of three to six earth weeks.

Once opened, two large ripples form lips (two behind each other)  
  

#### Male genitalia

The male penis is a long smooth spike, which tip can unfold into two sections to deliver the load. The surface is textured in such a way that insertion is smooth and easy, but taking out can hurt if done too fast, but with the sweet spot of pleasure at a certain speed. Additionally, it has small channels on the sides to lubricate it.

On its base are ripples that almost perfectly fit into the female counterparts. It’s flexible enough, even when erected, to fit through the bend leading to the cavity. The channel where the semen flows through in the middle is large enough to fit certain toys.
