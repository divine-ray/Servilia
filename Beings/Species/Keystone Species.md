This page tries to explain and come up with the effects of various species in this world on their environment, and how their home ecology would falter and collapse in their absence. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species?wprov=sfti1#Limitations
what kind of “supernatural” or unusual keystone species do we have, and what exactly is their impact?
[[Steelver]] -> what do they do with the metal they consume/absorb? do they construct something?

and there’s no way that all the pseudoneo don’t have an impact on the environment 
m
maybe the [[Long Savannah]] and [[Scorched Acres]] are shaped by more than just the hearth (and lode)
[[Dragonkin|Dragons]] and [[Worldship Nemus|World-Tree]]s definitely have a large impact, as the massive ass trees ought to be an entire ecosystem of its own

some kinds of dragon digging caves also could explain an unnaturally high occurrence of near-surface level caves

[[Iceworm|Iceworms]] are definitely considered a keystone species to the eternal glacier.
