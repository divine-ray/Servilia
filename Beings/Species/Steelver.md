Steal Beaver;
a nocturnal critter presumably related to a regular beaver, who diverged after exposure to [[Divinity]].

mostly looking akin to a regular beaver, with the major deviations being looking slightly "deflated" and more bony.
Second, they are equipped with abnormally enlarged eyes and sturdy teeth, which seem to be of an unknown but extremely hard compound, capable of scraping away at metal.

Their fur is not nearly as smooth as their natural counterpart and unusually bristly, which has encouraged many if not all families to 'cultivate' some sort of mud plating infused with the metal filings they feed on. This 'cultivation' is done in almost perfectly recurring rituals in a previously unseen level of sociality and coordination. 
A few initial shootings and kills have confirmed this plating to be useful as light but very brittle armour plating (with limited regeneration capabilities since it's just mud). 
Under the current projections it is foreseeable for the steelver population to become problematic to Friscoan, especially railroad related, infrastructure by causing structural failures.
