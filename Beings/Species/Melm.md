A creature that possibly resembles a fish, this species has specialised to survive in the icy subterran streams of the [[Black Forest]]. Fishy scales have almost entirely been replaced over time with several layers of fatty 'skin' and bony plating. Most colouring and pigmentation faded away into a dull blueish dull grey, ideal for blending into the icy waters and its beds. 
Their fins grew out and hard, shaping more into claws, capable of acting like an ice pick in the frozen streambeds. 
They are highly valued and hunted for their fat, as it makes for an unpleasant but very energetic fat. 
Their diet primarily consists of detritus and what ever so happens to drop into the streams.
