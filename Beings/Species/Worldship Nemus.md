An ancient breed of trees, distantly related to the norse Yggdrasil. Each capable of bearing planes of existence as fruits. 
Once towering across the realm, their roots reaching beyond the twilit, their leaves rustling in the solar wind. 
It was these trees that provided shade and cover from the watch- and dreadful eyes of the gods above. Only after they have been cut, felled by the hubris of Man was when the gods aquired insight to their playthings. So began the [[Siege of Ohrthyrst]], the fall from Light and Wood.  

The few remaining seeds have been cultivated into residences by the [[Dragonkin]].
