There he stands, he who rules the dreary transit. 
A sordid, wretched god: down from his hairy chin
A length of beard descends, neglected, uncombed, unclean. 
His eyes, like fiery kilns, burnt with seeing the vermin he bears. 
A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire.

Couldn't you vermin spare a petty penny for the one who brings you salvation from your wretched coil?
***
The Ferryman, he who hauls the souls of the deceased to the [[Afterlives]] over [[Styx]] and across [[Acheron]]. 
He rides on a flimsy boat, [[gifted to him]].  During the Transit, he judges the souls through deception and interrogation. Most souls consider it a solace, as the transit is drear and dire. 
Oftentimes [[I hear the songs|singing]] his songs, as to occupy him during the oh so ever static ferrying. 
His song is known among those who long since died, and feared by the living, for it calls forth deathly omens.
