On the first Mount comes [[Warfare|War]], upon a chariot of blood-forged steel,
On the second mount arrives [[Conquest]], upon a regal carriage,
On the third mount brings [[Famine]] itself forth, atop a starved donkey,
On the fourth mount stays [[Death]], skeletal and diseased.

The four harbingers of the [[Apokalypsis]]. They cannot be beaten, riding high across the domain.
