Disembodied [[Shnūt]], manifested concept of navigation using stellar constellations. 
Usually benevolent towards travellers, aiding their voyages. adored by many (past) civilisations as deity of travel.
Typically falsely associated with starlight itself, through which it is forced to meet the [[Queen of Shadows]]. 
Commonly depicted as derivatives of compass roses, as this emblem both provides context to maps and pleads the blessing of this entity. 

It is capable of altering starlight to guide and influence people. This is especially noticeable in [[Amida]] as the current [[Eternal Sea]] [[Spelljammers]] navigate using constellations. 

Primary group of worship are the [[Lunatics]] in Stargard. 
[[Alma’ḍuṭhd]] is the product of the lunatics trying to force a fragment of the Navigator into a vessel.
