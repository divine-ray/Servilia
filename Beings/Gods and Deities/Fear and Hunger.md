The god of Fear and Hunger, sharing family with the [[Apocalyptic Quartet]] of [[Death]], [[Famine]], [[Warfarefare]] and [[Conquest]]. 
Wicked, outright wrong, this warped tyrant is defying creation, placing itself unruly in the place of the just judge of death and decay. 
Arose from a human vessel that only experienced fear and hunger in its short life, which has been ended through ritual means.  

The few worshippers of this deity are typically struck with misery and pray for a betterment of their situation through a divine act. 
	These poor beggars, scum and scoundrel they may be, are met with one last resolution: true Death. 
Actively rejected as foul and wrong by most, if not all organised religions, as this deity only brings misery and drags attention of the Apocalyptic Quartet. 

No living person has ever bestowed their gaze upon the personification of misery, lest few who experienced hallucinations described **it** as starved, deformed humanoid, standing tall regardless.
