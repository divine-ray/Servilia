[[The Void|Void-borne]] Creature, docile unless provoked or perceived.
A lanky, slender pitch-black creature, erratic in its movement and appearance.
It appears to... shift? 
Usually hides within shadows around the Hollow Mountains and The Fountainhead.
Few reports of the [[Alp Peaks]] have claimed them to be in masses there. 

These appear during night-time and will likely assault exhausted travellers and the resting.


Passively inflicts psychical damage and increases Insanity.

1d6+n psychical damage, n being insanity.

### Lost Vessel Theory
These are likely Vessels without Mask which are loose and running wild.
Carrying any Vessel components (cloth, mask) will gain their attention regardless of position and such, and they will attempt to acquire the components for themselves.

 

Understanding Celestial and Abyssal makes them directly addressable (100% chance) and allows the player to understand them. Still increases insanity.

Directly addressing these with names may turn them docile again.

Spoken Magic and Grandam Cant is highly effective and makes them vanish.
