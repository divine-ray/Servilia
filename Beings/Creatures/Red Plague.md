The Red Plague is the original ancestor of both [[Heart of Cold]] and [[Crimson Heart]] since it's the first organism to assimilate other biomass and inorganic matter. 
It gains its devastating strength from unity of its individual 'cells', since it is a compound organism where each sub-unit measures like 10-30 cm in diameter. 
Each cell is barely capable of surviving, but not thriving. Strength and reason comes through unity, as they merge they grow stronger and pool their limited intellect to gain reason. 
Composed of the flesh of its victims and whatever seems usable, such as blades and armour it shapes as horrid amalgam. Survival of individual cells is disregarded in favour of the collective and thus only the outermost units are given protection and defence.
