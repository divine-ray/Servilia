A refined amoeba, capable of entering bodies and interacting with their nervous system.
Originally developed as [[Pseudoneo]] by the Lavish to augment their bodies and capabilities (such as offloading coordination).
Almost facing extinction during the second era, these entities got rediscovered first from the group of Pseudoneo life by Amidaean scientists and directly utilised to override the Curse of the Undead. 
These can be directed to painlessly disable and finally terminate those afflicted with the Curse. 
%%exists as two variants, as enhancer or as autonomous entities%%
Few specimens managed to survive during the second era due to aggressive and invasive behaviour towards [[Hollowed|hollows]] as host. Commonly coined zombies, as the amoeba possessing a hollow one are often struggling with the load that coordinating the entire body does, as the brain of the hollow is defunct or consumed.
In fact, a symbioparasite within a hollow usually thrives off the body mass until it completely consumed all tissue available. 
This is a forcibly induced behaviour, as their “host“ does not need to eat. 
Within a normally functioning host^[read: 'alive'], the symbioparasite would simply leech some of the nutrients in the host‘s body from digestion. 

Few written documentation exists about this group due to their parasitic and unseen behaviour. However, it appears that [[Dragonkin]] at some point cultivated these. 

It is rumoured^[by whom?] that some specimen present that augment various bodily systems.
