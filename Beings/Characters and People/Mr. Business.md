%%Extremely wealthy and powerful businessman, of Texan oil corp descent. Has control over many companies and corporations and will use them for his goals.%%

Smug businessman and aaa he scheming a lot of malicious things for his own profits, stripped of all morale. [[Greed]] incarnate. 
Owns a LOT of business shares in the confederation, etc.
Likely Number One for corrupting the government of the Confederation. 
The sole antagonist pushing [[Development of Petrochemistry]] as opposed to harnessing the [[Searing Lode]] for [[Steam Turbines]]. 
His taxmen, as they're called, are repeated offenders of theft and property damage.


His true name or identity is not known, just everyone refers to him as Mr. Business.
	Maybe he's a Hollowed possessed by a malicious spirit of [[Greed]]?
