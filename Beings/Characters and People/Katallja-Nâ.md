A necromancer, who has a acquired taste and incline towards felines. 
She governs smaller squadrons of [undead cats](Undead%20Cat.md) for her elusive and mischievous plans. Notably, those include intelligence and spying activities, which yield her a sizable knowledge of both international political diplomacy and a poor man's troubles. 

Born handmaid, she always aimed to cause lesser chaos in the world without hurting anyone, as vengeance to those who forced her into this unwanted and belittling role. 
Essentially a rebel against the norms and rigid structures, therefore she favours odd and rare clothing such as wide-swaying robes worthy of a god-emperor, glowing and flowing with the chaotic energies of life and death.
