Glorious, mighty he reigns over his Kingdom Davern, along with His Wife, the [[Everlong Empress]].
[Little is what remains of him to this day](The%20Old%20King). 

He is the one who harboured scatters of the [[Nølkā]] within Davern, safe from Thylyian persecution. 
Loosely affiliated with the [[Frisco Bay Confederation|Bay Confederation]], He has encouraged His Citizen to collect and study artifacts in attempts to understand the old crafts of the Lavish and 

Traded his humanity for power at the [[throne of ascension]], making one pact after another with the Davern [[Nølkā]] to push the point of undying, which caused his body severe disfiguration over time. 

The disfigurement and self-inflicted dehumanisation in the name of his own goals has left him revered, but with a bitter taste of egoism, as he sought his own profit before advancing and protecting his fiefdom. 
He knew with what forces he bargained. Finally achieved eternal life, at cost. Torn apart, His Body lies conscious but in agony.
