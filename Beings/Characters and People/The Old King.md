The skeletal remains of The Former [[Davern Kingdom|Davern]] [[King Erl the Yellow|King]], bound under the fort-castle of [[Auvergne]].

He remains aware, having to look at the world from below.

Revered to as God by the citizens and people of Davern, yet He has been forgotten if not for folk and rumours. Regardless, as if for spite, his bones and flesh, torn apart from another, exist onwards. 
Both knowing they'll never be, never see, never know. What was whole once will not be true again. 
The flesh, locked in a coffin, mummified, yet refusing to decay. 
Yearning for freedom, to roam the realm in a haze. 
	Yet, nothing but a [[Yawning Grave]]. 
His deceased, desecrated flesh remains wrapped in his mighty golden-yellow garb and robe, whom vermin reduced to scraps.
The bones, restrained onto the Throne, inanimate, yet full of spirit. 
Forever they must atone for their sins, united in suffering, separated in physios. 
Sharing a [[ancient dragon of Auvergne|fate...]]


Known as [[King Erl the Yellow]], Earlking or other permutations during his reign, in which he raised [[Davern Kingdom|Davern]] to it's current state of greatness.
