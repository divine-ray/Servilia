%%The dock-worker that filed the [[Return of Automatia]] :: (41 y-o)%%
%%Has pale skin, suffers from poor nutrition and used to be rather bulky but his physique has withered under his hard work.%%
My name is Manuel, I am employed in Brisbourne Harbour as technician and responsible for the hot rock technology that drives [[Automatia]], and was largely involved in the planning and construction.
I am rather lonely and isolated in my off-time and primarily gather with my colleagues, who, with me, moved to Brisbourne from [[Duley and Port]]. 
I've been given the report of the situation at [[Blighthurst]] and it‘s abandonment, but I do not believe in the dangers from it. 
My [[Superior]] has been delegating the issues and his tasks down onto me. Lazy bastard. However, i have thus been given the direct information about the situation of Automatia, and also know that they haven‘t been signalling in a… concerning time. 

I've been dreaming very erratically recently and i am afraid. My body has been wilting. I used to be strong, and look at me now, i am nothing but a decayed flower, brittle like a stick. 

> There‘s [[another person]] who has installed the radio sparking technology in Automatia, with whom he is forced to collaborate. They have received *a* signal, which we are certain is from Automatia.
