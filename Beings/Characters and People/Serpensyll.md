- [ ] #TODO 
An orkish assassin, hired by the [[Lunatics]] to pacify and retrieve [[Alma’ḍuṭhd]]. Extremely ruthless and devoid of emotions. Along the backside of his neck are runic tattoos, purpose unknown. 

Possibly his relentless determination and strength sources from raw infusions of twilit/amarisk using ramshackle Vaaruú implants. 
 
His moral compass is severely damaged, ruthless towards his targets.
He is a half-orc and is very scarred.

The Party may choose to either work with or against him.
