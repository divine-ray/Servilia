Graham has bright-white dreadlocks and amber eyes. He wears a white silk suit and a black leather trench coat, and carries a switchblade hacknife. 
He has undergone several cosmetic treatments to bleach his skin bright white with golden threads embedded on the body-plating seams. This grants him a heavenly appearance. 

Graham is under bounty by [[protoGEN Industrial Group]] for illicit access of [[A-5b]], through which he caused a [[Memory Fracture]], which led way to the [[Rouge Matter-Energy]] incident occurring and now terrorising the entirety of Amida.
