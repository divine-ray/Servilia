so.
I have like, no idea where to start with them, but I am pretty sure that they will converge/merge with [[Conversion V3]] 
species: IPC
Age: 29 simulated terrean years, current chassis might as well be 100+ terran years
pronouns: they/it, devoid of real genderinos 

if I would have to guess then they might be a part of the second-third gen synthetic sentience from [[Amida]], which, after arduous negotiations and conflicts, were let go without laws and conditioning (yet still seen and treated inferior to organics, especially humans)
 they have gotten interstellar and had to send out resilient personell onto spacecraft which do not require complex life support and sustenance

given the fact that an IPC brain is rather resilient and can be somewhat easily swapped between chassis it explains that MeeR is apt and capable at salvage, engineering (primarily shuttle craft) and science (primarily robotics)

MeeR is primarily concerned about efficiency and productivity, less so about survivability (especially of organic crew mates), with even less regard for their own existence. 

its current chassis is made for the rock-on duty of salvaging and mining, running the bare minimum to minimise loss in case of fatal damage (which occurs rather often with hostile xenofauna)
