The barkeep of [[SICK]], or rather, the chief of bar (in SICK, the bar is treated jokingly as micronation). 
Uses an agender goat anthromorph body.  
They're blind on one eye and refusing to get cybernetics to fix it due to personal beliefs in corporeal sanctity. In line with this, they installed several robotic arms and the likes on the otherwise perfect replica of a 1800's saloon bar to help with creating drinks.  
People keep mispronouncing their nickname for Gin, which might’ve been intended.  
Runs a loose gossip aggregation group along with the other bar staffs as pastime, yet giving them quite ahold of happenings and news, which guests do inquire.
