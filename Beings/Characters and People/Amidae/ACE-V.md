ACE/ACVs are the airborne combat unit of APAS Ltd.â€™s [[Catalogue of Armaments]]. 
They cover a variety of roles associated to their construction and build designated after once-known bird species.
As with MECH units classification varies on independence. ACEs are slightly to fully independent entities with intellect, and ACVs are human operated vehicles with little autonomy.

ACEs can act completely autonomous and are, in some cases, capable of synthesising their ammunition. The majority of ACEs are also able to process and digest ordinary food as fuel. 
On the other side, ACVs have a hard reliance on external fuel and ammunition.
Current available models/applications are as follows:
- Pigeon 
	- Multi-Class Utility
- Albatros
	- High Altitude Bomber/recon and surveillance
- Condor
	- Cargo and Infantry transportation
- Eagle
	- Precision projectile airstrikes 
- Kolibri 
	- VTOL/STOL weapons platform 
- Sparrow
	- Swarm-coordinated ACE unit
- Swallow 
	- High-speed^[1] air-to-ground assaults
