Won't you come down, get off that roof?
Jump now. We can end this now. 
Don't, you are just drunk. 
We're fine, there is nothing wrong.
You are holding a bottle of booze, you are drunk. 
What's all of this chattering?
Jump already, end it. 
Where you go, i'm going, jumping and falling. 
So end it all now, it's pointless resistance for you. 
It's empty- It's chaos, confusion.
You might not feel a reason for existence, nor purpose for living, it's all just projection and gloom- 
Feel your breath run deep below you.
Let the wind pick us up, already. 
I want to know what it is to fly. 
You wouldn't hold back my dreams, would you? 
That'd make you a bad person. 
We don't have wings, we can't fly-
There's no difference between falling or flying, until you meet the ground. 
The Wind, it is burning into my thoughts. I am cold. I'm freezing.
