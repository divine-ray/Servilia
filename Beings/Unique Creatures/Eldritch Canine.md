A skeleton of a giant dog, about as tall as a man. [[Greed]] manifested in a coin, socketed in the skull.
Leeches off life force of victims as they try to take their coin, gaining their flesh and skin in exchange.
Their life for its wealth. A fair bargain.
It begins the trade for inquiring the name of the traded.
If the adressee dares to speak up their fate is sealed. A coin for a life. 
Only a fair exchange.
