living tar, kinda like death stranding or risk of rain 2 -
[[Dunestriders]], their tar and crude oil made animate distorted and alienated [[Mogu]] which have lost their cognition. 
The very essence of the Mogu and other amorphous organisms, assimilated [[Symbioparasite|Symbioparasites]] drives these molasses across the desert and savannah. 
Embodies chaos given form, a senseless mass. 
Dead organic mass, ash, mud and soil may coalesce into this ooze under unstable weave conditions. 

Sometimes incurs within the veins and bodies of those wielding the forces of the arcane. 
If such cases occur, it has to be expelled and removed out of the body as fast as possible, lest it may lead way to aplenty of issues, such as circulatory failure and sepsis.
