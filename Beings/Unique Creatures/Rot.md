Called into life and set free by the scourges of all divine, this wretched lump has raised itself to the apex predator, a blind and endless killer, seeking out any ascendants to brutally eviscerate their flesh and to twist and shatter their spirit. 
One solution to wreak havoc to any organisation resembling faith. To devour belief, to shatter the oh-so indomitable human spirit into splinters.

[[Nølkā-Mekhanite War|War]].

Clumps of brown. Of raw, fouled flesh. 
Flesh, cut from the womb of planets : of [[Yaldabaoth]]’s energy. 
***
All of this, for nothing.
Mankind as we knew it has died, succumbed. Turned into vegetation. What they once looked down upon with pity and spite was now their mortal enemy, able to exterminate a “Human” without second thought. They, what they called “Animals”, are blessed to thrive without thought, without sentience. They can just exist. Their life is simple, there is no complex social structure, no perceived duties, responsibilities outside of self-sustenance.

End.
