The Original Sin against the Flesh: created by the [[Nølkā]] as the first living weapon to see widespread use and devastating sucess against any- and everything it devours. 

The Red Plague is the original ancestor of both [[Heart of Cold]] and [[Scarlet Hearth]] since it's the first 
organism to assimilate other biomass and inorganic matter. 
It has only one purpose: Devour the Mekhanites. 
It has caused a death toll of millions in the short months of activity already. 
It is a compound organism where each sub-unit measures like 10-30 cm in diameter.
It devours what it seems fit: rocks, trees, corpses, animals, tools, entire vehicles. 
It will tear apart, warp and fit to serve its greater objective. 
It needs biomass to grow, to ~~birth~~ *create* new cells. 
It needs more cells, more mass, more murder, more deaths to progress.
It gains its devastating strength from unity of its individual 'cells'. 
It understands it can only operate with enough cells. 
It will be sentient with enough mass. 
It will sacrifice every part. 
Its hunger is insatiable. 
It will fulfil its task. 
***
Each cell is barely capable of surviving, but not thriving. Strength and reason comes through unity, as they merge they grow stronger and pool their limited intellect to gain reason. 
Composed of the flesh of its victims and whatever seems usable, such as blades and armour it shapes as horrid amalgam. 
Survival of individual cells is disregarded in favour of the collective and thus only the outermost layers are given protection and defence.
